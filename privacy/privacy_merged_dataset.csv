However, the traditional IoT data aggregation model relies on a central data aggregator, such as a third-party cloud server, and uses traditional encryption technology to process data, which may face problems such as original data leakage and calculation errors, and it is difficult to ensure that data participants can safely participate in the aggregation. Due to its homomorphic characteristics and performance improvements in recent years, homomorphic encryption technology makes it possible to use homomorphic encryption technology to protect data privacy during data transmission and calculation. In addition, as a non-tamperable ledger technology, the blockchain can be used to store evidence, specifically to store the promises made by the commitment mechanism, and complete the verification of data consistency and correctness. © 2023 SPIE.",,,"Gao, Yue (58577458600); Huang, Zhiqing (55494547900); He, Jun (58577458700)",58577458600; 55494547900; 58577458700,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1271738,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171281022&doi=10.1117%2f12.2684676&partnerID=40&md5=e38ceb558a69d9d81cdaaf6e12f8f8c2,Blockchain; data aggregation; Homomorphic Encryption; Iot; privacy; verifiable,Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Aggregation schemes; Block-chain; Data aggregation; Encryption technologies; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Iot; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Verifiable; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85171281022,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Li T.; Wang H.; He D.; Yu J.,Designated-Verifier Aggregate Signature Scheme With Sensitive Data Privacy Protection for Permissioned Blockchain-Assisted IIoT,2023.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/TIFS.2023.3297327,,,18,,,,,,,,,"Aggregate signatures enable the sensor nodes of Industrial Internet of Things to send their signatures to the aggregator to realize signature compression. Before being stored in the data center, sensitive data and non-sensitive data should adopt different data processing methods in the process of sensor data fusion. In the high security analysis scenario of Industrial Internet of Things, only the verifier with a specified high security level can verify the resulting aggregate signature. So far, no one has explored how to ensure sensitive data privacy in the designated-verifier aggregate signatures. Motivated by it, this paper proposes a designated-verifier aggregate signature scheme (named DVAS) based on permissioned blockchain to achieve sensitive data privacy. In this scheme, the aggregator can be used not only to aggregate signatures, but also to sanitize data. Through smart contracts, the aggregator can sanitize the sensitive data according to the contract, and convert the original signature of the sensitive data into a valid signature. Therefore, DVAS can achieve elastic sensitive data privacy, not limited to encryption operations.

This study, therefore, utilises the transparency, security, efficiency of blockchain technology along with the computing and storing facility at the edge level to establish privacy preserved storing and tracking schemes for electronic health records (EHRs). Since the EHR stored in a block is accessible by the peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes, privacy has always been a matter of great concern for any blockchain-based activities. Therefore, to address this privacy issue, multilevel blockchain, which can enforce and preserve complete privacy and security of any blockchain-based application or environment, has become one of the recent blockchain research trends. In this article, we propose an EHR sharing architecture consisting of three different interrelated multilevel or hierarchical chains confined within three different network layers using edge computing.

It has been assisted by a lot of interest in a decentralized and distributed public ledger system integrated as a peer-to-peer network. A tamper-proof digital framework is created for sharing and storing data, where the linked block structure is utilized to verify and store the data. A trusted consensus method has been adopted to synchronize the changes in the original data. However, it is challenging for Ethereum to maintain security at all blockchain levels. As such, “public–private key cryptography” can be utilized to provide privacy over Ethereum networks. Several privacy issues make it difficult to use blockchain approaches over various applications. Another issue is that the existing blockchain systems operate poorly over large-scale data. Owing to these issues, a novel blockchain framework in the Ethereum network with soft computing is proposed. The major intent of the proposed technology is to preserve the data for transmission purposes. This new model is enhanced with the help of a new hybrid algorithm: Adaptive Border Collie Rain Optimization Algorithm (ABC-ROA). This hybrid algorithm generates the optimal key for data restoration and sanitization. Optimal key generation is followed by deriving the multi objective constraints. Here, some of the noteworthy objectives, such as information preservation (IP) rate, degree of modification (DM), false rule (FR) generation, and hiding failure (HF) rate are considered. Finally, the proposed method is successfully implemented, and its results are validated through various measures.

Its fusion processing enables the further mining of data and utilization of data value and broadens the path for the sharing and dissemination of media data. However, it also faces serious problems in terms of protecting user and data privacy. Many privacy protection methods have been proposed to solve the problem of privacy leakage during the process of data sharing, but they suffer from two flaws: 1) the lack of algorithmic frameworks for specific scenarios such as dynamic datasets in the media domain; 2) the inability to solve the problem of the high computational complexity of ciphertext in multi-source data privacy protection, resulting in long encryption and decryption times. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data privacy protection method based on homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology, which solves the privacy protection problem of multi-source heterogeneous data in the dissemination of media and reduces ciphertext processing time. We deployed the proposed method on the Hyperledger platform for testing and compared it with the privacy protection schemes based on k-anonymity and differential privacy. The experimental results show that the key generation, encryption, and decryption times of the proposed method are lower than those in data privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity technology and differential privacy technology. This significantly reduces the processing time of multi-source data, which gives it potential for use in many applications. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, blockchain technology faces the problem of data availability attacks during its application, which greatly limits the scope and domain of blockchain applications. One of the most advantageous researches to address this problem is the scalable data availability solution that integrates coding theory design into the Merkle tree promise. Based on this scheme, this paper combines a zero-knowledge accumulator with higher efficiency and security with local repair coding, and proposes a data availability scheme with strong dataset privacy protection. The scheme first encodes the data block information on the blockchain to ensure tamper-proof data, and then uses a zero-knowledge accumulator to store the encoded data block information. Its main purpose is to use zero-knowledge property to protect the accumulation set information stored in the accumulator from being leaked and to ensure that no other information about the accumulation set is revealed during the data transmission.

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25% and encryption elapsed time by 48%. Furthermore, the proposed CP-ABE access control method is adaptive to storing and sharing a massive amount of data.

However, when the system collects the corresponding power data, several severe security and privacy issues are encountered. The identity and private injection data may be maliciously intercepted by network attackers and be tampered with to damage the services of ITS and smart grids. Existing approaches requiring high computational overhead render them unsuitable for the resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environment. To address above problems, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme for fog-based ITS. First, a fog computing and blockchain co-aware aggregation framework of power injection data is designed, which provides strong support for ITS to achieve secure and efficient power injection. Second, Paillier homomorphic encryption, the batch aggregation signature mechanism and a Bloom filter are effectively integrated with efficient aggregation of power injection data with security and privacy guarantees. In addition, the fine-grained homomorphic aggregation is designed for power injection data generated by all EVs, which provides solid data support for accurate power dispatching and supply management in ITS. Experiments show that the total computational cost is significantly reduced in the proposed scheme while providing security and privacy guarantees.

However, it also introduces a number of security and privacy issues not foreseen before. These are very serious issues from consumer's perspective who do not want any malicious entity to infer any personal information from the consumption data. Data aggregation plays a significant role in protecting user's consumption data. SGs deploy a single entity, called an aggregator, to collect and aggregate end users’ encrypted consumption data. While a number of secure data aggregation schemes have been proposed, many existing schemes suffer from a single point of failure in the aggregation process. Recently, some blockchain-based data aggregation schemes have been proposed to overcome this problem. While overcoming the failure issues, these schemes do not provide the necessary security and privacy requirements of smart grids. Furthermore, these schemes suffer from high computation and communication cost due to the use of RSA-based signatures. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a decentralized secure data aggregation scheme using blockchain which preserves privacy, integrity, authentication, and confidentiality of individual consumption data.

How to manage these massive data safely and reliably has become an important challenge for the medical network community. This paper proposes a data management framework of medical network community based on Consortium Blockchain (CB) and Federated learning (FL), which realizes the data security sharing between medical institutions and research institutions. Under this framework, the data security sharing mechanism of medical network community based on smart contract and the data privacy protection mechanism based on FL and alliance chain are designed to ensure the security of data and the privacy of important data in medical network community, respectively. An intelligent contract system based on Keyed-Homomorphic Public Key (KH-PKE) Encryption scheme is designed, so that medical data can be saved in the CB in the form of ciphertext, and the automatic sharing of data is realized. Zero knowledge mechanism is used to ensure the correctness of shared data. Moreover, the zero-knowledge mechanism introduces the dynamic group signature mechanism of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) anonymity, which makes the scheme more efficient in computing and communication cost. In the end of this paper, the performance of the scheme is analyzed from both asymptotic and practical aspects. Through experimental comparative analysis, the scheme proposed in this paper is more effective and feasible. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

As a significant carrier of medical data, electronic medical record (EMR) is convenient to be stored and retrieved, which greatly simplifies the experience of medical treatment and cuts down the trivial work of paramedics. However, EMRs usually include much sensitive information such as patients&#x2019; identification numbers or home addresses that may be easily captured by unauthorized doctors and cloud servers. Based on this concern, e-healthcare systems can make use of attribute-based encryption (ABE) to protect private information while achieving fine-grained access control of encrypted EMRs. Whereas, most ABE schemes do not support both policy hiding and keyword search. To address the above issues, we propose an inner product searchable encryption scheme with multi-keyword search (MK-IPSE) based on blockchain to provide full privacy preservation and efficient ciphertext retrieval for EMRs. Inner product encryption (IPE) can not only specify access permissions such that only users with matched attributes can get the target files, but also support access policy hiding. Besides, the proposed scheme combines searchable encryption (SE) and federated blockchain (FB) to implement efficient and stable multi-keyword search. Compared with the existing schemes, MK-IPSE shows better performance on computation and storage. Additionally, security analysis demonstrates that our scheme can resist IND-CKA and collusion attacks.

We introduce a decentralized data governance framework based on blockchain technology, proxy re-encryption, and Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (BBS) signatures to let data owners control, selectively share and track their data through privacy-enhancing, consent management, and selective disclosure mechanisms. Besides, our framework allows the data consumers to understand data lineage through a blockchain-based provenance mechanism.

The emergence of blockchain and federated learning brings new directions. In this paper, a data-sharing model that combines blockchain and federated learning is proposed to solve the security and privacy problems of data sharing in IoV. First, we use federated learning to share data instead of exposing actual data and propose an adaptive differential privacy scheme to further balance the privacy and availability of data. Then, we integrate the verification scheme into the consensus process, so that the consensus computation can filter out low-quality models.

The ML model processes the data management based on the number of transactions, time of transaction, and transaction confirmation time.

However, increasing ITS devices impose grand challenges in privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing. Recent research has demonstrated that integrating searchable symmetric encryption in blockchain enables privacy-preserving data sharing among ITS devices. However, existing solutions focus only on single-keyword searches over encrypted ITS data on the blockchain and suffer from privacy and efficiency issues when extended to multi-keyword scenarios. This work proposes a bloom filter-based multi-keyword search protocol for ITS data with enhanced efficiency and privacy preservation. We design a bloom filter to select a low-frequency keyword from the multiple keywords input by the ITS data owner. The low-frequency keyword can filter out a large portion of the ITS data from the search result, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, each identifier-keyword pair is attached with a pseudorandom tag that enables the completion of a search operation in only one round. In this manner, privacy is preserved because there are no intermediate rounds and results. In addition to the multi-keyword search protocol, we specify the addition and deletion protocols to enable dynamic updates of data records. We conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation of the protocols.

Therefore, a blockchain-based flight operation data sharing scheme, named BFOD is designed to achieve the privacy protection and secure sharing of flight operation data. In BFOD, physical entities of airlines, airports and air traffic control are divided into data owners, data requesters and authorization institutes according to the business logic. First of all, the authorization institute grants a hash anonymous identity and different levels of access right for each civil aviation corporation. When the data are accessed, a hash anonymous identity is designed to verify the access right of the data requester, which protects identity privacy. Then, zero-knowledge succinct noninteractive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) is employed to verify whether the flight operation data meets the specific requirements raised by the data requester without disclosing data privacy. Finally, a proxy re-encryption is used to improve the sharing efficiency of flight operation data. In addition, a grouped practical byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT) algorithm is proposed to reduce consensus latency. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the consensus latency of the grouped PBFT algorithm reduces 91.4% under the number of consensus node N=100, and the BFOD meets data confidentiality, availability and privacy protection, which is feasible and efficient.

Blockchain is a data-distributed processing technology that tracks data records to support secure electronic money transactions and data security management in a peer-to-peer environment without the need of a central trusted authority. The data uploaded to the blockchain-shared ledger are immutable, making tracking integrity preservation facile. However, blockchain technology is limited because it is challenging to utilize in the industry owing to its inability to correct data, even when inaccurate data are uploaded. Accordingly, research on blockchain mechanisms that consider privacy-preserving data management is required to commercialize blockchain technology. Previously, off-chain, blacklist, and hard-fork methods have been proposed; however, their application is challenging or impractical. Therefore, to protect privacy, we propose a layered blockchain mechanism that can correct data by adding a buffer blockchain. We evaluated the latency, security, and space complexity of layered blockchains. The security and security-to-latency ratio for data management of the selective layered blockchain is 2.2 and 11.3 times higher than the conventional blockchains, respectively. The proposed selective layered blockchain is expected to promote the commercialization of blockchain technologies in various industries by protecting user privacy. © 2023 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

The publish and subscribe (Pub/Sub) paradigm, with its asynchronous, one-to-many and decoupling characteristics, is considered to be a promising communication model in IoT. However, designing a Pub/Sub framework for IoT data sharing confronts two challenges: Byzantine faults and privacy concerns. Byzantine nodes that are subjectively malicious or hacked by attackers may discard or forge data in the broker network composed of untrusted IoT organizations. Unauthorized brokers or clients may try to obtain the content of publications or subscriptions, thus violating the IoT data privacy. Existing works have limitations in terms of relatively low scalability and high overhead in tackling these two challenges. In this paper, we propose Galaxy, a blockchain based Pub/Sub IoT data sharing framework. To achieve Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) Pub/Sub, Galaxy adopts sharding to improve scalability and achieve efficient BFT Pub/Sub workflow within each shard with a novel leader rotation scheme. In attaining privacy-preserving Pub/Sub, a secret key sharing and encrypted Pub/Sub scheme is designed in Galaxy to achieve low overhead without breaking the decoupling of the system. We implemented a prototype of Galaxy and deployed it on Alibaba Cloud for experimental evaluation. The experiment results show the feasibility and efficiency of Galaxy.

Previous secure outsourcing solutions mostly assume that the server is honest-but-curious while the adversary model of a malicious server that may return incorrect results is rarely explored. Moreover, with the increasing popularity of verifiable computations, existing verification schemes are yet not efficient and cannot cater to different scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based verifiable search framework for the adversarial cloud outsourcing context. When outsourcing the encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS), we also store the encrypted data index in a decentralized blockchain (i.e., Ethereum in this paper) which is public and cannot be modified. Once a user is authorized, he/she can flexibly obtain the query results and efficiently check the query integrity via the pre-deployed smart contract, without the need of the data owner being online. Moreover, for user's privacy protection, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to deliver the access authorization without any identity disclosure.

Data owners set up groups, generating and uploading their data to cloud storage, while other users in the groups download and make use of it, which is called group data sharing. As all kinds of cloud service, data group sharing also suffers from hardware/software failures and human errors. Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes are proposed to check the integrity of data stored in cloud without downloading. However, there are still some unmet needs lying in auditing group shared data. Researchers propose four issues necessary for a secure group shared data auditing: public verification, identity privacy, collusion attack resistance and traceability. However, none of the published work has succeeded in achieving all of these properties so far. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based ring signature PDP scheme for group shared data, with an instance deployed on a cloud server.

As an essential prerequisite for mining potential value from these data, data sharing is crucial and getting more and more attention. However, security and privacy concerns, and the lack of effective incentive mechanisms in the decentralized environment hinder the data owners from sharing their data. In this paper, we propose a federated learning and blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing system, which solve the privacy leakage problem of federated learning and the scalability problem of blockchain by their technical complementarity. Considering the resource shortage and the heterogeneity of terminals, we first design a cross-layer architecture by exploiting the cloud-edge-terminal collaboration, and innovatively propose differential data sharing by dividing the providers into origin data providers and model providers. Then, we design a targeted incentive mechanism to maximize the utility of requesters and two types of data providers by formulating it into a two-stage Stackelberg game. Finally, a gradient-based algorithm is designed to get the optimal solution. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed data-sharing system could eliminate privacy concerns and motivate more participants to share data.

Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy. Our solution fully considers the characteristics of Web3 and can well support the diverse Web3 applications.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.",,,"Guo, Shaoyong (36182369500); Zhang, Fan (57355289100); Guo, Song (58594251100); Xu, Siya (56783318200); Qi, Feng (57203571816)",36182369500; 57355289100; 58594251100; 56783318200; 57203571816,IEEE Communications Magazine,,28.0,34.0,6.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169617795&doi=10.1109%2fMCOM.001.2200408&partnerID=40&md5=b27c0cfbcce9e4e31eaa5e2431b545e9,,Computer architecture; Data obfuscation; Distributed computer systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Web services; Block-chain; Complete control; Computing architecture; Computing process; Computing scheme; Data Sharing; Decentralised; Privacy preserving; User privacy; Webs services; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85169617795,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the current device binding requires direct identifiers and grants manufacturers ownership of the generated data, limiting user control and raising privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a blockchain-based platform with two distinct blockchains: decentralized identity and physiological data. Users register decentralized identities on the first blockchain, which are then used for device binding on the second blockchain, enabling de-identified data collection. The platform generates user-specific smart contracts on the Physiological Data blockchain and ensures complete user control over data access.

People join in group and share data with each other, making team work more convenient. This new application scenario also faces data security threats, even more complex. When a user quit its group, remaining data block signatures must be re-signed to ensure security. Some researchers noticed this problem and proposed a few works to relieve computing overhead on user side. However, considering the privacy and security need of group auditing, there still lacks a comprehensive solution to implement secure group user revocation, supporting identity privacy preserving and collusion attack resistance. Aiming at this target, we construct a concrete scheme based on ring signature and smart contracts. We introduce linkable ring signature to build a kind of novel meta data for integrity proof enabling anonymous verification. And the new meta data supports secure revocation. Meanwhile, smart contracts are using for resisting possible collusion attack and malicious re-signing computation. Under the combined effectiveness of both signature method and blockchain smart contracts, our proposal supports reliable user revocation and signature re-signing, without revealing any user identity in the whole process.

In this paper, we consider the problem of privacy-preserving file retrieval. A new framework named PriFR is proposed by integrating the blockchain and cloud computing infrastructures. The large-scale original files are encrypted and outsourced to the public cloud server. The encrypted retrieval indexes are stored on the full nodes in the blockchain to support traceable and unforgeable retrieval services. This design embraces the benefits brought by both cloud computing and blockchain. For the first time, PriFR decomposes the file retrieval problem into the numerical query and keyword search on the file metadata. In doing so, each file can be characterized more precisely than the traditional keyword search based schemes. In addition to functionality, PriFR only applies fast and lightweight symmetric cryptographical primitives to reach near plaintext retrieval efficiency. In specific, the numerical query is implemented atop order-preserving encryption (OPE) that is perfectly compatible with plaintext indexing techniques. The price for such high efficiency is its vulnerability to inference attacks. Given enough background knowledge, the plaintext can be recovered with high probability. To resist this attack, PriFR injects differential privacy noises into the raw data to offer guaranteed privacy-preserving strength with a negligible extra efficiency cost. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of PriFR.  © 2023 IEEE.",,,"Ren, Hao (57188835251); Xu, Guowen (57189258305); Qi, Han (58314074000); Zhang, Tianwei (55635885400)",57188835251; 57189258305; 58314074000; 55635885400,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE 9th International Conference on Big Data Security on Cloud, IEEE International Conference on High Performance and Smart Computing, and IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Data and Security, BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS 2023",,16.0,23.0,7.0,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161800663&doi=10.1109%2fBigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS58521.2023.00014&partnerID=40&md5=6778e4dcd86d66e036d271e489592859,big data; Blockchain; cloud computing; private query; searchable encryption,Big data; Cloud computing; Efficiency; Privacy-preserving techniques; Search engines; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Files retrieval; Keyword search; Large-scales; Plaintext; Privacy preserving; Private query; Retrieval systems; Searchable encryptions; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85161800663,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data transmitted and stored through the network have the risk of privacy leaking. Encrypting the shared data can satisfy the need of the privacy, and retrieving the encrypted data can make the data used efficiently. However, to enable users to retrieve encrypted data and perform fine-grained authorization on their encrypted files is still a great challenge. Although attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) is a well-received solution to the challenge, there are still privacy and efficiency issues if the traditional ABKS schemes are directly used in blockchain data sharing. In order to solve the problems, this article proposes privacy protection data retrieval scheme with an inverted index, which is an application of attribute-based encryption. First, our scheme is proved secure against the outside keyword guessing attack (KGA) and chosen keyword attack (CKA) under the semitrusted model. Second, the scheme returns a multikeywords ranked result. Third, we analyze the efficiency of our scheme and verify it by simulation.

An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved.

To solve these two problems, we propose a new privacy-preserving medical data-sharing scheme by introducing the authorization mechanism and attribute-based encryption (ABE) based on blockchain, which breaks system boundaries and realizes data sharing among several medical institutions. ABE is used to realize scalable access control. In addition, doctors can share their knowledge to diagnose users by introducing many-to-many matching, which means that patients' health data can be represented by multiple keywords and doctors' expertise can be represented by multiple interests.

In particular, we explore the barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration between law and computer science that we faced, and how these two fields’ different expectations as to what technology can do for data protection law compliance had an impact on the project's development and outcome. We also explore the overstated promises of techno-regulation, and the practical and legal challenges that militate against the implementation of our PET: most industry players have no incentive to deploy it, the transaction costs of running it make it prohibitively expensive, and there are significant clashes between the blockchain's decentralised architecture and GDPR's requirements that hinder its deployability.

Based on sensing-as-a-service in microgrid, sensor owners and sensor data consumers can effectively perform data sharing operations. However, the state-of-the-art sensor data sharing works in microgrid have the following two limitations: (i) cannot support fine-grained authorization for sensor owners and sensor data consumers and (ii) fail to simultaneously consider confidentiality and authenticity for sensor data sharing. To address the problems, in this article, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving sensing data sharing system with fine-grained authorization in microgrid. Technically, we employed attribute-based signature methodology to design a fined-grained authorization mechanism for sensor data users.

A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named sensorkey) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the sensorkey to each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer's public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the sensorkey, and one encryption of the sensorkey for each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient sensorkey retrieval from the consortium blockchain. The sensorkey is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes. © 2022",,,"Hu, Xiaoyan (55496214500); Song, Xiaoyi (57221853039); Cheng, Guang (7401862789); Wu, Hua (55703663100); Gong, Jian (55901043400)",55496214500; 57221853039; 7401862789; 55703663100; 55901043400,Computer Communications,,44.0,54.0,10.0,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135113560&doi=10.1016%2fj.comcom.2022.07.035&partnerID=40&md5=0217ae09c313a6061556237df57c2e10,Consortium blockchain; Data sharing; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Wireless sensor network,Data Sharing; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Efficiency; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensor nodes; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Data Sharing; Group key agreement; Multiple data; Multiple organizations; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Sensing data; Sink nodes; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85135113560,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, centralized learning usually creates issues in terms of data privacy, data control, and data security. To address these issues, decentralized AI, especially federated learning, is proposed to achieve no data sharing or data exchange across servers and decentralized devices. This paper proposes a new decentralized AI paradigm based on blockchain, which goes beyond the decentralized federated learning to require no model pooling or orchestrating on any central server. That is, we propose further decentralization by dismissing the central or-chestrator in federated learning through the usage of blockchain (e.g., Ethereum in this paper), which is inherently a decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer and autonomous mechanism. We implemented a prototype to demonstrate the idea, in which models are trained on data contributors' ends. Instead of moving models to a central place for combining (such as in federated learning), models are trained independently on data contributors' sides, and flow to the decentralized blockchain for updating. In this process, smart contracts on Ethereum provide specifications required for model creation. In addition, data contributors are rewarded Ether coins for their contributions to train the model with their data. This also incentivizes data contributors to provide data for AI training while protecting their data privacy.  © 2023 IEEE.",,,"Masurkar, Anand Surendra (58175888500); Sun, Xiaoyan (55783042200); Dai, Jun (55783189600)",58175888500; 55783042200; 55783189600,"2023 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications, ICNC 2023",,195.0,201.0,6.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152006457&doi=10.1109%2fICNC57223.2023.10074247&partnerID=40&md5=31f4b045767ed2621e9a7402129e0c6a,Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Data privacy,Artificial intelligence; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; Ethereum; Learning systems; Block-chain; Central servers; Centralised; Centralized server; Data contributors; Data control; Data Sharing; Decentralisation; Decentralised; Model training; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85152006457,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blockchain technology relies on traditional cryptography to ensure data integrity and verifiability, but the creation of quantum computing has made it possible to break traditional encryption and signature methods. Therefore, quantum blockchain can provide a higher level of security for handling medical data. This paper innovatively designs a new medical data processing system based on quantum blockchain (QB-IMD). In QB-IMD, a quantum blockchain structure and a novel electronic medical record algorithm (QEMR) are proposed to ensure that the processed data is legitimate and tamper-proof. QEMR combines quantum signature and quantum identity authentication to avoid the potential security risks of digital signatures.

To enhance the precision of diagnosis, different participants in SHNs share health data that contain sensitive information. Therefore, the data exchange process raises privacy concerns, especially when the integration of health data from multiple sources (linkage attack) results in further leakage. Linkage attack is a type of dominant attack in the privacy domain, which can leverage various data sources for private data mining. Furthermore, adversaries launch poisoning attacks to falsify the health data, which leads to misdiagnosing or even physical damage. To protect private health data, we propose a personalized differential privacy model based on the trust levels among users. The trust is evaluated by a defined community density, while the corresponding privacy protection level is mapped to controllable randomized noise constrained by differential privacy. To avoid linkage attacks in personalized differential privacy, we design a noise correlation decoupling mechanism using a Markov stochastic process. In addition, we build the community model on a blockchain, which can mitigate the risk of poisoning attacks during differentially private data transmission over SHNs.

A data buyer transfers funds only if the correct key material is uploaded to the blockchain. Second, to guarantee fine-grained data trading and preserve identity privacy, we build a Merkle hash tree on the ciphertexts of data with a signature on its root node, which allows a data seller to split data into blocks and remove the sensitive information from the data without affecting data availability verification. The public key of the data seller is not leaked to the data buyer during the trading. Moreover, different trading transactions from the same data seller cannot be linked.

Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner.

Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR.

Despite being beneficial, these applications are massively relying on gathering sensitive information from the mobile devices, which creates numerous challenges regarding security and latency problems. For instance, these applications’ stakeholders take their time to select mobile device for gathering necessary resources. Therefore, this process of recruiting mobile devices will not be practical with sensing information which has an expiration date, which the time of collecting and recruiting these types of sensing information are surpassing its expiration date. As device-to-device (D2D) paradigms have been established as relevant communication for sharing sensing information in a low latency and minimum cost, it still suffers from mobility problems. Hence, mobile edge caching (MEC) system has been developed to increase efficiency of information sharing with mobility of high-flexibility. Nonetheless this paradigm has some challenges with regards to constructing a satisfactory resource sharing system concerning security and trust ability.

Due to the openness of the network, the UAV cluster is more vulnerable to passive eavesdropping, active interference, and other attacks, which makes the system face serious security threats. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Based Data Acquisition (BDA) scheme with privacy protection to address the data privacy and identity authentication problems in the UAV-assisted data acquisition scenario. Each UAV cluster has an aggregate unmanned aerial vehicle (AGV) that can batch-verify the acquisition reports within its administrative domain. After successful verification, AGV adds its signcrypted ciphertext to the aggregation and uploads it to the blockchain for storage. There are two chains in the blockchain that store the public key information of registered entities and the aggregated reports, respectively. The security analysis shows that the BDA construction can protect the privacy and authenticity of acquisition data, and effectively resist a malicious key generation center and the public-key substitution attack. It also provides unforgeability to acquisition reports under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) assumption. The performance analysis demonstrates that compared with other schemes, the proposed BDA construction has lower computational complexity and is more suitable for the UAV cluster network with limited computing power and storage capacity. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

To be specific, firstly, symmetric encryption algorithm is utilized to encrypt medical data to protect the privacy of data owner. Secondly, our proposed system is built on a new blockchain framework, in which only visitors with permission can access the medical data. Thirdly, we employ chameleon signature to prevent visitors from sharing data with other parties without permission.

However, the heterogeneity of information systems used by various medical institutions makes sharing difficult. In addition, since medical data involves a great deal of sensitive information, sharing it could easily lead to the leakage of personal privacy. Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time.

As a result, Federated Learning (FL) (also called collaborative learning) has emerged as a new training paradigm that allows multiple, geographically distributed nodes to learn a Deep Learning (DL) model together without sharing their data. Blockchain is becoming a new trend as data protection and privacy are concerns in many sectors. Technology is leading the world and transforming into a global village where everything is accessible and transparent. We have presented a blockchain enabled security model using FL that can generate an enhanced DL model without sharing data and improve privacy through higher security and access rights to data. However, existing FL approaches also have unique security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit and compromise the trained model. The FL method is compared to the other known approaches. Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users’ data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Blockchain-assisted data aggregation enables the traceability of sensing data to improve the trustworthiness of data aggregation results. However, directly using blockchains for data aggregation may introduce the risk of privacy leakage because all nodes, including malicious nodes, can access the data on blockchains.

First, the sensing nodes are divided into multiple groups, and each group maintains a private blockchain to store the data aggregation records, which avoids the leakage of the aggregated results and ensures the traceability of the sensory data. Then, a zero-sum noise-adding mechanism is utilized to not only preserve the private information during aggregation and ensure the correctness of the aggregated results but also improve the efficiency of privacy preservation.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set.  © 2022 IEEE.",,,"Hardin, Taylor (57195201969); Kotz, David (7006805893)",57195201969; 7006805893,Proceedings - International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems,,144.0,156.0,12.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140912077&doi=10.1109%2fICDCS54860.2022.00023&partnerID=40&md5=004b1de75ff7a2437d906a8e55579289,,Access control; Data privacy; Machine learning; Audit trails; Block-chain; Data confidentiality; Data Sharing; Data systems; Data users; Sensitive application; Trusted execution environments; Trusted party; User privacy; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85140912077,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably in the COVID era, inner personal and private information is being shared between healthcare providers regarding the medical supply chain. In recent years, multiple cyber-attacks have targeted medical supply chain communication networks due to their lack of security measures. In the era where cyber-attacks are cheaper and easier due to the computational power and various algorithms available for malicious uses, security, and data privacy requires intensive and higher measures. On the other hand, Information Hiding Techniques (IHT) compromise various advanced methods to hide sensitive information from being disclosed to malicious nodes. Moreover, with the support of Blockchain, IHT can bring higher security and the required privacy levels.

However, since cloud systems are centralized, there is serious concern about data security and privacy. Blockchain technology is viewed as a promising method of dealing with privacy issues and data security because of its exclusive features of distributed ledgers, secrecy, verifiability, and enhanced security. The literature review has shown significant works on integrating blockchain technology with cloud system for managing and sharing healthcare data. It has been analyzed that previous works are primarily dependent on the centralized data storage approach, which raises privacy concerns. The previous works also do not emphasize handling big medical data and lack the reliability of the end-to-end security features system. This paper has presented an authorization framework for ensuring data security and privacy preservation using blockchain technology with IPFS as decentralized file storage and sharing system. The proposed study devises a proof of replication algorithm using smart contracts to provide a better access control mechanism. The implementation of the proposed framework is based on the symmetric encryption and Ethereum blockchain platform.

Mostly, the records are stored on healthcare cloud and application (HCA) servers, and thus, are subjected to end-user latency, extensive computations, single-point failures, and security and privacy risks. A joint solution is required to address the issues of responsive analytics, coupled with high data ingestion in HBD and secure EHR access. Motivated from the research gaps, the paper proposes a scheme, that integrates blockchain (BC)-based confidentiality-privacy (CP) preserving scheme, CP-BDHCA, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC)-based digital signature framework, HCA-ECC is proposed to establish a session key for secure communication among different healthcare entities. Then, in the second phase, a two-step authentication framework is proposed that integrates Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES), named as HCA-RSAE that safeguards the ecosystem against possible attack vectors. CP-BDAHCA is compared against existing HCA cloud applications in terms of parameters like response time, average delay, transaction and signing costs, signing and verifying of mined blocks, and resistance to DoS and DDoS attacks. We consider 10 BC nodes and create a real-world customized dataset to be used with SEER dataset. The dataset has 30,000 patient profiles, with 1000 clinical accounts. Based on the combined dataset the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes like AI4SAFE, TEE, Secret, and IIoTEED, with a lower response time. For example, the scheme has a very less response time of 300 ms in DDoS. The average signing cost of mined BC transactions is 3,34 seconds, and for 205 transactions, has a signing delay of 1405 ms, with improved accuracy of ≈ 12% than conventional state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Ghayvat, Hemant (56644813700); Pandya, Sharnil (57200178916); Bhattacharya, Pronaya (57200306370); Zuhair, Mohd (56341258100); Rashid, Mamoon (57191990629); Hakak, Saqib (56297179100); Dev, Kapal (57190336390)",56644813700; 57200178916; 57200306370; 56341258100; 57191990629; 56297179100; 57190336390,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,,1937.0,1948.0,11.0,50.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110818554&doi=10.1109%2fJBHI.2021.3097237&partnerID=40&md5=66f5cf907c1854a2e8cc424200aa6068,Big Data; Blockchain; DoS and DDoS attacks; ECC signatures; Healthcare Cloud and Applications; pairing-based cryptography; secure session key management,Big Data; Blockchain; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Delivery of Health Care; Ecosystem; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Privacy; Authentication; Big data; Blockchain; Cryptography; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Network security; Privacy by design; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cloud applications; Denial of Service; Electronic health record; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Single point failure; State-of-the-art approach; adult; article; big data; blockchain; cloud computing; confidentiality; controlled study; denial of service attack; ecosystem; electronic health record; encryption; human; ingestion; medical service; privacy; reaction time; computer security; confidentiality; ecosystem; health care delivery; privacy; Denial-of-service attack,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85110818554,,,,,,,,,,,,

While extant studies focus on cryptography and differential privacy, few of them capture the utility and authenticity of data. As a result, data privacy remains the primary concern when training a machine learning (ML) model with IoMT data from various data sources/owners such as k − medoids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this study proposes secure ​k − medoids ​that are implemented together with Blockchain and partial homomorphic cryptosystem (Paillier) to ensure authenticity and protect all entities (i.e., data owner and data analyst) data privacy. The homomorphic property of Paillier is utilized to develop secure building blocks (i.e., secure polynomial operations, secure comparison, and secure biasing operations) to ensure data privacy and eliminate dependency on any third parties. We utilized three different biomedical datasets, and these are (I) Heart Disease Data (HDD), (II) Diabetes Data (DD), and (III) Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data (BCWD). Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure ​k − medoids ​protect against sensitive data breaches. It also showed superior performance in both BCWD (Accuracy 97.80%, Precision 96.83%, and Recall 99.80%) and HDD (Accuracy 82.50%, Precision 81.28%, and Recall 80.50%) datasets, respectively. However, similar performance was not reflected in the case of the DD dataset. Furthermore, the study explains why such performance results are observed.

The remarkable security feature of the blockchain is that the blockchain verifies the transaction initiated on each block through the node, and its process is broadcast throughout the whole network to let everyone know. On the one hand, this ensures the security of every transaction, but on the other hand, it is easy to cause privacy disclosure problems for transaction users. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring the security of the blockchain, it has become a hot issue to protect the sensitive information of transaction users. A check-in privacy protection (CPP) algorithm based on check-in location generalization is proposed in this paper, which can be applied to blockchain transactions to solve the privacy leakage problem of transaction users' sensitive information. CPP algorithm not only protects the privacy of check-in data but also keeps the high utility of trajectory pattern data. Firstly, location types are recommended in the sensitive check-in location generalization based on the user's trajectory pattern by using Markov chain technology. Secondly, to make sure that the generalized locations can be scattered as much as possible to prevent the attacker from deducing back, a heuristic rule is designed to select the generalized location based on the recommended location types, and at the same time, the similarity between the anonymous trajectory and the original trajectory is maintained.

For sharing the traffic data with other vehicles, the vehicular sensory data are usually uploaded to the cloud server. However, existing data sharing systems for VANETs cannot provide selective data with sufficient privacy protection. Moreover, some schemes also cannot ensure stable data accessibility and the integrity of retrieved data. On the other hand, with the improvements such as lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth, 5G technology brings more possibilities to future applications. The join of the software-defined networks (SDNs) also offers efficient and effective network management. This paper proposes a primitive vehicular communication system named blockchain-based privacy-preserving and sustainable data query service. The proposed scheme is designed to realize stable data accessibility by leveraging smart contracts and blockchain oracle. With the help of 5G technology and P2P file-sharing system, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the proposed scheme aims to support video downloading files with searchable capability and fairness. An incentive token mechanism is also equipped. The merit of auditability is ensured by Ethereum blockchain platform to support the accountability. Besides, we also evaluate its networking performance via SUMO and NS-3 simulators. Our simulation results show that the request-response delay of BPSDQS is less than existing blockchain-based proxy re-encryption (PRE) scheme. Our simulation results also showed that the average request-response delay in our scheme can saving up to 98%.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",,,"Yeh, Lo-Yao (8839883700); Shen, Nong-Xiang (57444318900); Hwang, Ren-Hung (7103381899)",8839883700; 57444318900; 7103381899,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,,15909.0,15921.0,12.0,13.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124236224&doi=10.1109%2fTITS.2022.3146322&partnerID=40&md5=b511923f1276d9461225065bd5d8cad0,blockchain; InterPlanetary File System (IPFS); proxy re-encryption; software defined network (SDN); Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET),5G mobile communication systems; Blockchain; Intelligent systems; Peer to peer networks; Privacy-preserving techniques; Search engines; Traffic congestion; Vehicular ad hoc networks; 5g mobile communication; Block-chain; Filesystem; Interplanetary file system .; Mobile communications; Proxy re encryptions; Software defined network; Software-defined networks; Streaming medium; Vehicular ad-hoc network; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Smart contract,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85124236224,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many challenges inhibit the development of using IoT applications in smart cities, such as issues of privacy, scalability, trust, security, and centralisation. On a daily basis in smart cities, the IoT generates a large amount of data (big data) which could potentially be used for questionable or suspect purposes by attackers. The weight of the security issues surrounding big data must be acknowledged as the associated technology is continuously developing. To solve this issue, a strategy that secures important and potentially sensitive user information on a distributed blockchain and transmits non-sensitive information to the primary system by controlling the size of the blockchain is proposed. This solution cannot be achieved in traditional blockchain because it requires too many resources. The model is composed of three proposed algorithms: the first aims to allocate data to each user; the second performs the process of searching for data, and the third confirms the communication process. Experiments have proved that this proposed protocol for blockchain has excellent byzantine fault tolerance. The final experimental results of the proposed model established that the algorithms effectively meet the performance requirements. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Moreover, the in-depth research and development of 6G and AI technology further strengthen the interconnection of various entities in VANET and can realize edge intelligence, which fundamentally enhances the efficiency of data sharing. However, reliable transmission and secure storage of data have always been a great challenge in data sharing. Although some schemes store shared data in the blockchain, most of the consensus mechanisms they use employ full nodes to verify signature information and timestamps, which cannot effectively judge the reliability of the shared data itself. Some other schemes use scoring mechanisms to evaluate data uploaded by vehicles, but these methods can be affected by network hardware failures and cannot effectively detect duplicate data. In addition, participants' privacy may also be disclosed in the process of data sharing, such as participants' location and identity information. Therefore, to address the above problems, this paper proposes a data sharing scheme in 6G-VANET, which can not only ensure the reliability and security of shared data but also protect the privacy of participants. Firstly, a consortium chain is adopted to realize the secure storage of shared data in 6G-VANET, which meets the requirements of tamper-proof and traceability of data. Secondly, a voting consensus mechanism is designed in combination with smart contract to ensure the reliability of data. Thirdly, the trained word2vec natural language processing model is deployed to edge nodes to realize edge intelligence, effectively eliminate the duplicate shared data, and enhance storage efficiency. Finally, a participant privacy protection mechanism is designed using the Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol, and a secure and efficient data sharing scheme is finally realized. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by security analysis and experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the time and space overhead of blockchain can meet the practical requirements, and the proposed PSI protocol of large-scale vehicles can be completed in a short time.  © 2022 Zhihua Wang et al.",,,"Wang, Zhihua (57191513084); Xu, Yingheng (57827595100); Liu, Jiahao (57222902324); Li, Zhenyu (57220577879); Li, Zeminghui (57827729900); Jia, Hongyong (24329334400); Wang, Dinghua (57827796900)",57191513084; 57827595100; 57222902324; 57220577879; 57827729900; 24329334400; 57827796900,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,5031112,,,,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135259035&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5031112&partnerID=40&md5=c78d7500f428c12ae1884660ca5060c3,,Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Reliability; Storage efficiency; Vehicles; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Edge intelligence; Intersection protocols; Privacy protection; Secure storage; Set intersection; Shared data; Sharing schemes; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85135259035,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data stored in each of the healthcare institution remain in silos which cannot be easily shared with other institutions due to technical and infrastructural constraints. Hospitals do not have an effective and secure data sharing mechanism leading to monetary and resource loss in the case of a person visiting different hospitals. Blockchain, a disruptive technology with secure and reliable decentralized framework, and can be used to circumvent problems in traditional healthcare architecture for secure storage, sharing and retrieval of Electronic Health Records (EHR). A blockchain-based framework integrated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for EHR in healthcare management has been proposed in this paper. This proposed framework will enable healthcare institutions to maintain fail-safe and tamper-proof healthcare ledgers in a decentralized manner. Hospitals and doctors act as lightweight nodes, whereas patient nodes can be full or lightweight nodes. The model proposes two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication for preventing fake node attacks. Patient-centric access model allows the patients to act as digital stewards for their health data, allowing access to doctors and hospitals on demand and revoking it after stipulated time. Symmetric key encryption (AES-128) is used for encrypting data before storing into IPFS. Asymmetric encryption (RSA-4096) is used for generating digital envelopes to pass on symmetric key to authorized entities. Digital signatures (RSA-1024) make sure that the transactions are valid and from authorized nodes. Hashing of the encrypted data is done using SHA-256 algorithm. Multiple layers of security implemented in this model makes sure that adversaries cannot obtain data stored in IPFS; even if they retrieve the data, it will not be meaningful since it is encrypted. The proposed framework for off-chain storage of health data using IPFS saves blockchain structure from scalability issues. Further the proposal for blockchain integration with IPFS helps preserve privacy in the healthcare system, making it highly secure, scalable and robust. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Jayabalan, Jayapriya (57223124069); Jeyanthi, N.

In this article, we present a triple subject purpose-based access control (TS-PBAC) model, which is compatible with a blockchain-enabled reliable transaction network, and design an individual-centric security and privacy-preserving mechanism for access control with different purposes and roles in IoMT scenarios. Specifically, we design hierarchical purpose tree (HPT) and related policies to guarantee the legality of an external user with different purposes. To improve the privacy for sensitive attributes against an internal attacker, we design a local differential privacy (LDP)-based policy and role-based access control scheme in an edge computing paradigm to grant fine-granularity rights for authorized users. In addition, we introduce mutual evaluation metrics to evaluate data quality from a patient-and-medical-service level in an open anonymous network, only using logs kept in the blockchain. We test our approach by real-world EMRs with 100000 patients. The experimental results show that the proposed privacy-preserving scheme can better protect patient's privacy than traditional access control policies in IoMT environments, and can make reliable and stable access control decisions between data publishers and data requesters with different purposes.  © 2014 IEEE.",,,"Wu, Guangjun (55483759500); Wang, Shupeng (55922362400); Ning, Zhaolong (57225156511); Li, Jun (58434383500)",55483759500; 55922362400; 57225156511; 58434383500,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,8091.0,8104.0,13.0,19.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122087297&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2021.3138104&partnerID=40&md5=aced90e50219b0a0327218bd87fb29df,Blockchain; electronic medical records (EMRs); Internet of Medical Things (IoMT); privacy-preserving information,Blockchain; Diagnosis; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Privacy-preserving techniques; Quality control; Block-chain; Internet of medical thing; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical services; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving information.; Security; Sensitive attribute; Access control,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85122087297,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, with the power of machine learning techniques, one can envision that a new paradigm for AIoT, a combination of AI and IoT, can accomplish many novel IoT applications. A feasible, safe, and trusty data trading environment is necessary to realize this AIoT service paradigm. The classic approach of centralized trust centers is not suitable for the targeted scenario due to privacy, vulnerability, and efficiency concerns. The emerging blockchain technology could be the perfect solution; yet, it remains a challenging issue to ensure data provider's privacy. Thus, this paper envisions a blockchain- based AIoT service paradigm and proposes solutions for preserving privacy. To preserve privacy in data storage, we adopt the approach of a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network. For preserving privacy in on-chain metadata, especially the GPS records of the personal videos, we propose a privacy-preserving geometric search scheme (PPGSS).

Additionally, healthcare data is highly regulated by US & EU privacy and security laws and international laws governing data storage in the cloud. The value of healthcare data and these regulatory requirements have motivated organizations to use blockchain to protect data. Blockchain will facilitate effective data exchange while maintaining patient privacy and data protection. Cloud data has long been a draw for cyber attackers. Today, cloud health data has been their latest interest. The cloud-based application that theoretically transforms the operation and communication of existing healthcare networks is EHR. The EHR is a digital file comprising the personal details of citizens/patients (name, photo, address, age, etc.) and health (existing diseases, previous surgeries, allergies, blood type, allergies, vaccinations, etc.). Maximizing cost efficiency is one of the drivers for integrating cloud services in health care. The return on investment for healthcare services is better when using cloud solutions. The cloud infrastructure includes a centralized medical record entry point, allowing many clinicians to display laboratory reports or consult patient notes. Loud technologies would allow researchers to explore these data and analyses public health more accurately. Cloud technology is not the best way to handle the medical services and records of the healthcare system. Nevertheless, this technology allows patients and physicians access to software that will enhance patient care. The Cloud also provides an excellent opportunity to utilize patient data on a health computer scale to draw insights on health and allow patients to manage personal details quickly and efficiently. There are hurdles in introducing emerging technologies and threatening privacy violations, but health services will utilize this increasingly growing and valuable technology with the appropriate training and framework.

Hence, a suitable IoT data market needs to be established, and the provision of safe and effective trading services for multiple buyers and sellers is required. This paper introduces an IoT data market framework supported by blockchain. It focuses on a transaction realization scheme for multiple buyers and sellers. In the scheme, the mechanisms are designed to determine the corresponding data providers and recipients for the buyers and sellers, respectively, and the transaction prices of both parties. When the data market runs, an inference attack will raise bid information leakage issues. We study a transaction scheme that enables differential privacy protection of bids based on an exponential mechanism. This paper theoretically proves the individual rationality, weak budget balance, and truthfulness of the normal transaction scheme and differential privacy-based transaction scheme. This paper also theoretically proves the effectiveness of the differential privacy protection for bids of transaction participants.

The onion-routed query conceals the network identity of the sensors from external adversaries, and obfuscates the actual computation to hide it from internally compromised nodes.

However, despite increased attention to the security of electronic health records, patient privacy is still at risk for data breaches. Thus, it is quite a challenge to involve an access control system especially if the patient's medical data are accessible by users who have diverse privileges in different situations. Blockchain is a new technology that can be adopted for decentralized access control management issues. Nevertheless, different scalability, security, and privacy challenges affect this technology. To address these issues, we suggest a novel Decentralized Self-Management of data Access Control (DSMAC) system using a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model for privacy-preserving medical data, empowering patients with mechanisms to preserve control over their personal information and allowing them to self-grant access rights to their medical data. DSMAC leverages smart contracts to conduct Role-based Access Control policies and adopts the implementation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to describe advanced access control techniques for emergency cases. Finally, by evaluating performance and comparing analyses with other schemes, DSMAC can satisfy the privacy requirements of medical systems in terms of privacy, scalability, and sustainability, and offers a new approach for emergency cases.  © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Saidi, Hafida (57214824611); Labraoui, Nabila (36179757000); Ari, Ado Adamou Abba (57193017438); Maglaras, Leandros A.

In order to solve the problem of privacy protection in logistics big data systems, a new kind of logistics user privacy data protection scheme is proposed. First of all, an access rights management mechanism is designed by combining blockchain and anonymous authentication to realize the control and management of users’ access rights to private data. Then, the privacy and confidentiality protection between different services is realized by dividing and storing the data of different services. Finally, the participants of the intra-chain private data are specified by embedding fields in the logistics information. The blockchain node receiving the transaction is used as the transit node to synchronize the intra-chain privacy data, so as to improve the intra-chain privacy protection within the business.

However, the collected data may contain users' sensitive information. When guaranteeing the utility of data, we need to consider privacy of users' data. To balance the utility and the privacy of data, the existing approaches usually adopt the privacy-preserving signature technology, where the privacy-preserving data are classified by a designated converter (data processor) interacting with a semihonest verifier (data center). However, for the malicious behavior of the data center and data processor, this kind of approach is insufficient. To prevent the malicious data center/data processor while guaranteeing the utility and privacy of data, we propose blockchain-based auditable privacy-preserving data classification (PPDC) scheme for IoT. We put forth a new controllably linkable group signature (CL-GS) to balance the utility and privacy of data and take advantage of blockchain to audit the correctness of privacy-preserving data classification against malicious data processor/data center. We formalize the system model of the auditable privacy-preserving data classification in the blockchain setting and its security model.

In this paper, we propose a privacy protection scheme for multidimensional data aggregation and access control in the cloud Internet of Things for smart grid. The scalable access control based on attribute encryption is used to determine the data security of power user data in the process of data information sharing in the blockchain under the large data traffic of the cloud platform, which is to achieve privacy protection and fine-grained access control for demand-side multidimensional data. By using the EBGN homomorphic encryption algorithm, the multidimensional data is encrypted, and each dimension can be decrypted separately using the corresponding private key. The multidimensional data aggregation at the gateway can aggregate the multidimensional data into cipher-text, and the control center does not need to decrypt the cipher-text data of each dimension, thereby simplifying the operation of the gateway and the control center and improving the security and privacy of the data. By encrypting the EBGN private key of each dimension through the cipher-text policy attribute encryption algorithm, the fine-grained access control at the dimension level is realized. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the security of private data in the aspect of multidimensional data privacy protection, thus reducing the security risk of multidimensional data being illegally accessed.

Collecting data from multiple parties for analysis and mining will serve people better. However, it also brings unprecedented privacy threats to the participants. Therefore, safe and reliable data publishing among multiple data owners is an urgent problem to be solved. We mainly study the problem of privacy protection in data publishing. For a centralized scenario, we propose the LDA-DP algorithm. First, the within-class mean vectors and the pooled within-class scatter matrix are perturbed by the Gaussian noise. Second, the optimal projection direction vector with differential privacy is obtained by the Fisher criterion. Finally, the low-dimensional projection data of the original data are obtained. For distributed scenarios, we propose the Mul-LDA-DP algorithm based on a blockchain and differential privacy technology. First, the within-class mean vectors and within-class scatter matrices of local data are perturbed by the Gaussian noise and uploaded to the blockchain network. Second, the projection direction vector is calculated in the blockchain network and returned to the data owner. Finally, the data owner uses the projection direction vector to generate low-dimensional projection data of the original data and upload it to the blockchain network for publishing. Furthermore, in a distributed scenario, we propose a correlated noise generation scheme that uses the additivity of the Gaussian distribution to mitigate the effects of noise and can achieve the same noise level as the centralized scenario. We measure the utility of the published data by the SVM misclassification rate. We conduct comparative experiments with similar algorithms on different real data sets. The experimental results show that the data released by the two algorithms can maintain good utility in SVM classification.  © 2022 Zhen Gu et al.",,,"Gu, Zhen (57219244869); Zhang, Kejia (55450242300); Zhang, Guoyin (8271473300)",57219244869; 55450242300; 8271473300,Security and Communication Networks,5612794,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130954093&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f5612794&partnerID=40&md5=8be5bef94b5811786bea37a603bb1fd9,,Data privacy; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Matrix algebra; Support vector machines; Vectors; Block-chain; Centralised; Class mean; Data publishing; Differential privacies; Direction vector; Mean vector; Projection direction; Within class; Within-class scatter matrix; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85130954093,,,,,,,,,,,,

The private data onto specific IoT devices can be combined with intelligent platform to provide help for future research and prediction. As an important digital asset, individuals can sell private data to get rewards. Problems, such as privacy, security, and access control prevent individuals from sharing their private data. The blockchain technology is widely used to build an anonymous trading system. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure. Performance analysis and experimental results show that BPRPDS is efficient and practical.  © 2014 IEEE.",,,"Li, Tian (57210994120); Wang, Huaqun (24833714700); He, Debiao (35603655700); Yu, Jia (56518399000)",57210994120; 24833714700; 35603655700; 56518399000,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,,15138.0,15149.0,11.0,45.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124206453&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3147925&partnerID=40&md5=ece29ab7d6f8a6ff7c02355dbb9297e8,Anonymity; blockchain; data sharing; ring signature,Authentication; Blockchain; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; User profile; Anonymity; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Privacy preserving; Private data sharing; Ring signature.; Ring signatures; Security; Sharing schemes; Smart contract,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85124206453,,,,,,,,,,,,

It effectively collects and shares data from the surrounding environment to achieve better IoT services. For data sharing, the publish-subscribe (PS) paradigm provides a loosely coupled and scalable communication model. However, due to the loosely coupled nature, it is vulnerable to many attacks, resulting in some security threats to the IoT system, but it cannot provide the basic security mechanisms such as authentication and confidentiality to ensure the data security. Thus, in order to protect the system security and users' privacy, this paper presents a secure blockchain-based privacy-preserving access control scheme for the PS system, which adopt the fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to ensure the confidentiality of the publishing events and leverage the ledger to store the large volume of data events and access crossdomain information. Finally, we analyze the correctness and security of our scheme; moreover, we deploy our proposed prototype system on two computers and evaluate its performance.

This paper proposes a privacy-preserving search result certification framework for IoMT data on 5G and edge computing-assisted blockchain networks. The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, the proposed framework introduces a blockchain platform involving 5G Edge servers to ensure tamperproof data storage. In addition, an encrypted data storage model and a symmetric-key cryptography-based privacy-preserving search mechanism are developed for the 5G Edge blockchain.

It is beneficial for remote-access transactions over telecommunication networks. Presently, this task is the most challenging one for researchers. People's mental status in the form of emotions is quite complex, and its complexity depends upon internal behavior. Emotion and facial behavior are essential characteristics through which human internal thought can be predicted. Speech is one of the mechanisms through which human's various internal reflections can be expected and extracted by focusing on the vocal track, the flow of voice, voice frequency, etc. Human voice specimens of different ages can be emotions that can be predicted through a deep learning approach using feature removal behavior prediction that will help build a step intelligent healthcare system strong and provide data to various doctors of medical institutes and hospitals to understand the physiological behavior of humans. Healthcare is a clinical area with data concentrated where many details are accessed, generated, and circulated periodically. Healthcare systems with many existing approaches like tracing and tracking continuously disclose the system's constraints in controlling patient data privacy and security. In the healthcare system, majority of the work involves swapping or using decisively confidential and personal data. A key issue is the modeling of approaches that guarantee the value of health-related data while protecting privacy and observing high behavioral standards. This will encourage large-scale perception, especially as healthcare information collection is expected to continue far off this current ongoing pandemic. So, the research section is looking for a privacy-preserving, secure, and sustainable system by using a technology called Blockchain. Data related to healthcare and distribution among institutions is a very challenging task. Storage of facts in the centralized form is a targeted choice for cyber hackers and initiates an accordant sight of patients' facts which will cause a problem in sharing information over a network. So, this research paper's approach based on Blockchain for sharing sufferer data in a secured manner is presented. Finally, the proposed model for extracting optimum value in error rate and accuracy was analyzed using different feature removal approaches to determine which feature removal performs better with different voice specimen variations. The proposed method increases the rate of correct evidence collection and minimizes the loss and authentication issues and using feature extraction based on text validation increases the sustainability of the healthcare system.  © 2022 Shrikant Upadhyay et al.",,,"Upadhyay, Shrikant (57194182904); Kumar, Mohit (57714023100); Kumar, Ashwani (57209569726); Karnati, Ramesh (55842450100); Mahommad, Gouse Baig (57705954600); Althubiti, Sara A.

To improve the efficiency of machine learning, people realize efficient data classification by supporting the ML model, namely, the support vector machine (SVM) model, which is used in the realization of linear classification. However, data security and data protection are not addressed in SVM classifier training from multiple entity-labeled IoT data. In the existing solution, they depend on the implicit hypothesis that learning data can be dependable collected from complex data providers, which is often not the reality. To solve the question between the above problems, in this article, we put forward a secure support vector machine - a secure SECURE SVM training scheme for protecting the privacy on encrypted IoT data based on blockchain. Firstly, a secure and dependable data encryption sharing platform is established among complex data providers by using blockchain technology, which is recorded in a distributed ledger. Secondly, the homomorphic cryptosystem is used to design secure components, and the secure polynomial multiplication is improved to design a secure SVM training algorithm, which only needs two interactions in one iteration and does not need a trusted third party.

While people are enjoying the convenience brought by the Internet, their concerns about personal privacy are gradually increasing. Maintaining the value stability of RMB payment means and the security and efficiency of RMB settlement system are the key measures to promote the internationalization of RMB. Aiming at the problem of data insecurity and untrustworthiness in traditional information systems, this paper proposes a data protection technology for information systems based on blockchain. In the hierarchical authority information system, multichain structure is adopted to divide the authority of nodes in each layer, so that only the nodes with corresponding authority can access and operate data. Private digital currency, which is based on blockchain technology and represented by payment token and stable currency, helps to improve the defects of the agent banking model but increases additional market risks and trust risks.

Data sharing is even more sensitive when it comes to national and individual interests and is a matter of national security and national interest. Although Privacy-Preserving Computing achieves privacy protection for input data in the process of multi-party collaborative computing. However, the original data, computing process, and results face verification problems. As a result, sharing data on the blockchain will leak private information. To ensure the security of personal privacy information and recording in monitoring systems, This paper studies the use of homomorphic encryption for the secure transfer of blockchain data.

Along with energy, finance, governance, etc., the healthcare sector is one of the most prominent areas where blockchain technology is being used. We all are aware that data constitute our wealth and our currency; vulnerability and security become even more significant and a vital point of concern for healthcare. Recent cyberattacks have raised the questions of planning, requirement, and implementation to develop more cyber-secure models. This paper is based on a blockchain that classifies network participants into clusters and preserves a single copy of the blockchain for every cluster. The paper introduces a novel blockchain mechanism for secure healthcare sector data management, which reduces the communicational and computational overhead costs compared to the existing bitcoin network and the lightweight blockchain architecture. The paper also discusses how the proposed design can be utilized to address the recognized threats.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps. © 2022 by the authors.",,,"Chen, Chinling (57214694244); Yang, Jiaxin (57435527000); Tsaur, Woei-Jiunn (35581292900); Weng, Wei (36640955900); Wu, Chihming (55763321800); Wei, Xiaojun (57435391600)",57214694244; 57435527000; 35581292900; 36640955900; 55763321800; 57435391600,Sensors,1146,,,,23.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123872454&doi=10.3390%2fs22031146&partnerID=40&md5=5b35034e37f378407bb45e95ab532dde,Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved,Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,2-s2.0-85123872454,,,,,,,,,,,,

BPDST can also share information without leaking or tampering with EMRs' privacy, achieving the purpose of sharing medical data and privacy protection.

While bringing convenience to people, the explosive growth of medical data will further promote the value of mining medical data. Obviously, finding out how to safely store such a large amount of data is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Additionally, the particularity of medical data makes it necessarily subject to great privacy protection needs. This reinforces the importance of designing a safe solution to ensure data privacy.

A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data. Finally, analysis and evaluation show that the proposed IoVChain scheme is feasible, safe, and extensible for the secure sharing of IoV data.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.",,,"Ma, Zhaofeng (7403601135); Wang, Lingyun (57211682782); Zhao, Weizhe (57219438195)",7403601135; 57211682782; 57219438195,IEEE Sensors Journal,,25472.0,25479.0,7.0,24.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098758741&doi=10.1109%2fJSEN.2020.3046752&partnerID=40&md5=46c0ab9d4b4a88c8e3254f2297be0321,Blockchain; Internet of Things; privacy protection; trusted data sharing,Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Internet of things; Machinery; Network security; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Analysis and evaluation; Automatic registration; Data management solution; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Intelligent management; Intelligent transportation; Internet of thing (IOT); Privacy and security; Data Sharing,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85098758741,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier’s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants’ privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate’s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods. © 2020 by the authors.

The model also ensures a secure data aggregation process with low computational overhead. The proposed model is 80% more effective than the traditional approach in detecting smart meter manipulation, and the computation cost is 20% to 80% less than existing techniques.

This solution brings together advances from the fields of identity management, confidential computing, and advanced data usage control. In the area of identity management, the solution is aligned with emerging decentralized identity standards: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID communication and verifiable credentials (VCs). In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual's data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals. Specifically, our design covers necessary roles in the data-sharing ecosystem: The issuer of personal data, the individual holder of the personal data (i.e., the data subject), a trusted data storage manager, a trusted license distributor, and the data consumer. The proof-of-concept implementation utilizes the decentralized identity framework being developed by the Hyperledger Indy/Aries project.

Data sharing in consortium blockchain has provided a promising direction for efficient privacy preserving government data sharing. However, since government data is not owned by a single person or any government employers, it is hard to attribute participants’ responsibility for motivating data sharing behavior in blockchain systems. Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach. The SOC approach can effectively identify different departments’ data retrieving requirements while efficiently sharing government data with trustworthiness in data content and controllability in data ownership. In particular, we utilize smart contracts to provide an onchain service to define data sharing agreements between government departments, which can identify ambiguous data retrieving requirements and formalize the process logic.

It enables vehicles to exchange vehicular data (e.g., GPS, sensors, and brakes) with different entities nearby. However, sharing these vehicular data over the air raises concerns about identity privacy leakage. Besides, the centralized architecture adopted in existing IoV systems is fragile to single point of failure and malicious attacks. With the emergence of blockchain technology, it has the chance to solve these problems due to its features of tamper-proof, traceability and decentralization. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving vehicular data sharing framework based on blockchain. In particular, we design an anonymous and auditable data sharing scheme using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technol-ogy so as to protect the identity privacy of vehicles while preserving the vehicular data auditability for Trusted Authorities (TAs). In response to high mobility of vehicles, we design an efficient multi-sharding protocol to decrease blockchain communication costs without compromising the blockchain security.

Recently, blockchain-based eHealth systems have achieved great success in terms of EMRs sharing and management, but there still remain some challenges. Permissioned blockchain-based solutions provide high throughput and scalability, but may suffer from rollback attacks and lead to privacy leakage. Designs based on the public blockchain, on the other hand, are more open and secure, but sacrifice scalability and have no incentives for medical institutions to join into the systems. Moreover, data retrieval in blockchain-based eHealth systems is inefficient because of the basic blockchain structure. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing and privacy-preserving eHealth system named SPChain. To achieve quick retrieval, we devise special keyblocks and microblocks for patients to store their EMRs. A reputation system is also constructed to motivate medical institutions to participate in SPChain. By using proxy re-encryption schemes, SPChain achieves medical data sharing for patients in a privacy-preserving manner. To evaluate SPChain, we leverage the distribution of miners in the real world to test the system's performance and ability to resist mentioned attacks. The results show that SPChain can achieve high throughput (220 TPS) with low storage overhead. Compared with the existing schemes, SPChain achieves lower time complexity in terms of data retrieving, and can resist proposed blockchain attacks as well as SPChain attacks. © 2021",,,"Zou, Renpeng (57210202823); Lv, Xixiang (56268598400); Zhao, Jingsong (57221140857)",57210202823; 56268598400; 57221140857,Information Processing and Management,102604,,,,40.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103768801&doi=10.1016%2fj.ipm.2021.102604&partnerID=40&md5=ec1dd341d5d9d9b9e7e929fa4020b389,Blockchain; Data sharing; Electronic medical record; Privacy; Reputation system,Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; eHealth; Medical computing; Scalability; Search engines; Block-chain; Data Sharing; e-Health systems; High-throughput; Medical data; Medical institutions; Medical record; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Reputation systems; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,2-s2.0-85103768801,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we propose a supervisable energy transaction data privacy protection scheme, which aims to trade off the supervision of energy transaction data by the supervisory authority and the privacy protection of transaction data. First, the concealment of the transaction amount is realized by Pedersen commitment and Bulletproof range proof. Next, the combination of ElGamal encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology ensures the authenticity of audit tickets, which allows regulators to achieve reliable supervision of the transaction privacy data without opening the commitment.

As genomic data contain various privacy-sensitive information, security schemes that protect confidentiality and control access are essential. Many security techniques have been proposed to safeguard healthcare data. However, these techniques are inadequate for genomic data management because of their large size. Additionally, privacy problems due to the sharing of gene data are yet to be addressed. In this study, we propose a secure genomic data management system using blockchain and local differential privacy (LDP). The proposed system employs two types of storage: private storage for internal staff and semi-private storage for external users. In private storage, because encrypted gene data are stored, only internal employees can access the data. Meanwhile, in semi-private storage, gene data are irreversibly modified by LDP. Through LDP, different noises are added to each section of the genomic data. Therefore, even though the third party uses or exposes the shared data, the owner’s privacy is guaranteed. Furthermore, the access control for each storage is ensured by the blockchain, and the gene owner can trace the usage and sharing status using a decentralized application in a mobile device. © 2021 by the authors.

Sharing health data is considered a key way to improve the quality of health care services and reduce the cost of health care. However, nowadays, many people will create electronic health records in different hospitals. In the process of cross-hospital diagnosis, due to the decentralized storage of electronic medical record in various hospitals, the electronic health records cannot be shared. This phenomenon will cause obstacles to doctors' diagnosis, impede data sharing and endanger patient privacy. To solve these problems, we propose an EHRs privacy protection data sharing scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, the original EHRs are securely stored in the cloud. The generated index is stored on the hospital private blockchain. Visitors can obtain the index of electronic health records through the blockchain. It's convenient to view the patient's electronical health records and diagnose the patient's condition in detail. In this way, the risk of medical data leakage can be greatly reduced. The advantages in the blockchain ensure that EHRs cannot be arbitrarily modified. Meanwhile, the original data is stored in the cloud, while the blockchain only stores indexes, which solves the problem of limited storage space in the blockchain. According to the current medical situation, we put forward Wanchain as a service (WaaS), and propose a cross-blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for electronic health records. Wanchain is used to achieve cross-blockchain secure access to EHRs data when patients visit different hospitals. In addition, our scheme ensures that patients can delete EHRs data effectively and freely. The safety and effectiveness of the system are proved through security analysis and performance evaluation. © 2021 IEEE.",,,"Wang, Yu (57224488427); He, Mingxing (35364204300)",57224488427; 35364204300,"2021 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics, ICCCBDA 2021",9442539,90.0,99.0,9.0,6.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107645373&doi=10.1109%2fICCCBDA51879.2021.9442539&partnerID=40&md5=3eb828d7cc0db546eadd90c24de54bec,cross-blockchain; electronic health records; privacy-preserving; WaaS,Advanced Analytics; Big data; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Medical computing; Privacy by design; Records management; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Electronic medical record; Patient privacies; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Quality of health care; Security analysis; Data Sharing,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85107645373,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay.  © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Tan, Liang (49562028100); Yu, Keping (56316023300); Shi, Na (57216585324); Yang, Caixia (57216583913); Wei, Wei (57198566861); Lu, Huimin (57209823396)",49562028100; 56316023300; 57216585324; 57216583913; 57198566861; 57209823396,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,,271.0,281.0,10.0,111.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112670673&doi=10.1109%2fTNSE.2021.3101842&partnerID=40&md5=c6f3eb1189145441e1c3032d92787dec,Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocation,Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85112670673,,,,,,,,,,,,

Private data is usually encrypted by a session key before being published on a consortium blockchain for privacy preservation. The session key is shared with transaction parties and auditors for their access. For decentralizing auditorial power, multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain jointly undertake the responsibility of auditing. The distribution of the session key to an auditor requires individually encrypting the session key with the public key of the auditor. The transaction initiator needs to be online when each auditor asks for the session key, and one encryption of the session key for each auditor consumes resources. This work proposes GAChain and applies group key agreement technology to efficiently co-audit privacy-preserving data on consortium blockchain. Multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain form a group and utilize the blockchain to generate a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys. The session key is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain together with the encrypted private data. Auditors then obtain the encrypted session key from the chain and decrypt it with their respective group decryption key for co-auditing. The group key generation is involved only when the group forms or group membership changes, which happens very infrequently on the consortium blockchain. We implement the prototype of GAChain based on Hyperledger Fabric framework. Our experimental studies demonstrate that GAChain improves the co-audit efficiency of transactions containing private data on Fabric, and its incurred overhead is moderate.  © 2021 IEEE.",,,"Hu, Xiaoyan (55496214500); Song, Xiaoyi (57221853039); Cheng, Guang (7401862789); Gong, Jian (55901043400); Yang, Lu (57612152600); Chen, Honggang (57612824000); Liang, Zhichao (57613480200)",55496214500; 57221853039; 7401862789; 55901043400; 57612152600; 57612824000; 57613480200,"Proceedings - 2021 17th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking, MSN 2021",,494.0,501.0,7.0,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128761178&doi=10.1109%2fMSN53354.2021.00079&partnerID=40&md5=b1125772be5bee8aa0829eba4107aaca,co-audit; Consortium blockchain; group key agreement; privacy preservation,Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Co-audit; Consortium blockchain; Decryption keys; Encryption key; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Private data; Session key; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85128761178,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immutability, decentralization and anonymity of the blockchain provided new ways for solving the aforementioned problems. This paper proposes a complete medical information system model based on blockchain technology, to realize the goal of safe storage and sharing of medical data. A data collection system based on Internet of Things (IoT) was also developed that can simultaneously collect data from different types of non-invasive medical instruments to realize real-time collection of patient health record during surgery (SHR). This system designed an anonymous medical data sharing scheme based on cloud servers and proxy re-encryption algorithm to improve the security of private medical data sharing. The system was implemented based on the permissioned blockchain architecture Hyperledger Fabric, and a dual-channel Fabric deployment architecture and medical chaincode were designed for data management and access control.

Due to recent laws and regulations (e.g, General Data Protection Regulation), PPRL approaches are increasingly demanded in real-world application areas such as health-care, credit analysis, public policy evaluation, and national security. However, the majority of the PPRL approaches consider an unrealistic adversary model, particularly the Honest but Curious (HBC) model, which assumes that all PPRL parties will follow a pre-agreed data integration protocol, and will not try to break the confidentiality of the data handled during the process. The HBC model is hard to employ in real-world applications, mainly because of the need to trust other parties fully. To overcome the limitations associated with the majority of the adversary models considered by PPRL approaches, we propose a protocol that considers covert adversaries, i.e., adversaries that may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat. In such protocol, however, the honest parties are able to detect this misbehavior with a high probability. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation of this protocol, we employ the Blockchain technology and propose an improvement in the most used anonymization technique for PPRL, the Bloom Filter. The evaluation carried out using several real-world data sources has demonstrated the effectiveness (linkage quality) obtained by our contributions, as well as the ability to detect the misbehavior of a malicious adversary during the PPRL execution. © 2021",,,"Nóbrega, Thiago (57215194888); Pires, Carlos Eduardo S.

K-anonymity is one of the most popular privacy protection solutions, in which the real location of the request vehicle (RV) can be covered by a cloaking area including the location of k-1 cooperative vehicles (CVs). However, K-anonymity assumes all CVs are always honest and thus offering opportunities for dishonest CVs to provide false location information. To combat such threats, we propose a trusted cloaking area construction (TCAC) scheme based on the trust mechanism to protect the location privacy of vehicles. In this article, the trust value is not only used to identify dishonest CVs, but also utilized to decide the LBS request of RV. A low trust value will make the LBS request be rejected due to dishonest and selfish cooperative behaviors when the RV has played the role of CV. To deal with the massive trust requirements caused by frequent vehicle movement, edge computing is employed to assist trust value evaluation. Moreover, traditional central and distributed trust data management may be unsuitable for vehicular networks. We also propose a blockchain-based trust data management method by combining vehicular regions partition, so as to rapidly evaluate trust value during the cloaking area construction. The security analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest CVs, inspire selfish CVs, and protect the location privacy of vehicles effectively, whereas the required computation time and communication cost are both limited. © 2014 IEEE.",,,"Feng, Jingyu (35795259100); Wang, Yin (57221306485); Wang, Jialin (57221315904); Ren, Fang (55430935100)",35795259100; 57221306485; 57221315904; 55430935100,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,9261579,2087.0,2101.0,14.0,24.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098792730&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2020.3038468&partnerID=40&md5=c46a8cbe793abe79814bbe561f5a837b,Blockchain; edge computing; privacy protection; trust; vehicular networks,Behavioral research; Blockchain; Information management; Location; Military vehicles; Privacy by design; Telecommunication services; Co-operative behaviors; Communication cost; Cooperative vehicles; Location information; Location privacy protection; Privacy protection; Vehicle movements; Vehicular networks; Location based services,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85098792730,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT data aggregation process is a non-trivial task. Generally, the IoT data aggregation process is based on centralized servers. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to coordinate several untrustworthy parties. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization while overcoming the trust problem. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT data aggregation may become a reasonable choice for the design of a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose PrivDA, a Privacy-preserving IoT Data Aggregation scheme based on the blockchain and homomorphic encryption technologies. In the proposed system, each data consumer can create a smart contract and publish both terms of service and requested IoT data. Thus, the smart contract puts together into one group potential data producers that can answer the consumer’s request and chooses one aggregator, the role of which is to compute the group requested result using homomorphic computations. Therefore, group-level aggregation obfuscates IoT data, which complicates sensitive information inference from a single IoT device.

Especially, to protect data privacy in the data aggregation process, the case count data is aggregated based on the Paillier cryptosystem's homomorphism. Besides, to reduce the time and storage overhead, we improved the adopted Hyperledger Fabric, thus lightening the data aggregation process. Finally, we simulated the proposed scheme and analyzed its security and performance to verify its feasibility and effectiveness.

In this environment, surrounded by technologies, data, and personal information, have become an essential and coveted tool for many sectors. In this scenario, where a large amount of data has been collected, stored, and shared, privacy concerns arise, especially when dealing with sensitive data such as health data. The information owner generally has no control over his information, which can bring serious consequences such as increases in health insurance prices or put the individual in an uncomfortable situation with disclosing his physical or mental health. While privacy regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), make it clear that the information owner must have full control and management over their data, disparities have been observed in most systems and platforms. Therefore, they are often not able to give consent or have control and management over their data. For the users to exercise their right to privacy and have sufficient control over their data, they must know everything that happens to them, where their data is, and where they have been. It is necessary that the entire life cycle, from generation to deletion of data, is managed by its owner. To this end, this article presents an Information Chain of Custody Model based on Blockchain technology, which allows from the traceability of information to the offer of tools that will enable the effective management of data, offering total control to its owner. The result showed that the prototype was very useful in the traceability of the information.

At the same time, it becomes a great concern that how to obtain optimal outputs from big data publishing and sharing management while protecting privacy. Many researchers seek to realize differential privacy protection in massive high-dimensional datasets using the method of principal component analysis. However, these algorithms are inefficient in processing and do not take into account the different privacy protection needs of each attribute in high-dimensional datasets. To address the above problem, we design a Divided-block Sparse Matrix Transformation Differential Privacy Data Publishing Algorithm (DSMT-DP). In this algorithm, different levels of privacy budget parameters are assigned to different attributes according to the required privacy protection level of each attribute, taking into account the privacy protection needs of different levels of attributes. Meanwhile, the use of the divided-block scheme and the sparse matrix transformation scheme can improve the computational efficiency of the principal component analysis method for handling large amounts of high-dimensional sensitive data, and we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm satisfies differential privacy. Our experimental results show that the mean square error of the proposed algorithm is smaller than the traditional differential privacy algorithm with the same privacy parameters, and the computational efficiency can be improved. Further, we combine this algorithm with blockchain and propose an Efficient Privacy Data Publishing and Sharing Model based on the blockchain. Publishing and sharing private data on this model not only resist strong background knowledge attacks from adversaries outside the system but also prevent stealing and tampering of data by not-completely-honest participants inside the system.  © 2021 Yiyang Hong et al.",,,"Hong, Yiyang (57396421200); Zhao, Xingwen (36661700200); Zhu, Hui (55717897100); Li, Hui (57218312611)",57396421200; 36661700200; 55717897100; 57218312611,Security and Communication Networks,2418539,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122259631&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f2418539&partnerID=40&md5=56838ee81b09095ddae2f6b98315b1a9,,Blockchain; Data privacy; Efficiency; Large dataset; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Metadata; Parameter estimation; Principal component analysis; Block sparse; Block-chain; Data publishing; Data Sharing; Differential privacies; High-dimensional dataset; Matrix transformation; Principal-component analysis; Privacy protection; Sparse matrices; Computational efficiency,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85122259631,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper suggests a method to implement a reliable clarification to these points. Traditionally sophisticated methods trading with the security of health records ordinarily makes information inaccessible system to patients. Certain methods struggle to adjust information reliability, patient desire, and regular communication with supplier information. Blockchain(BC) resolves the preceding difficulties from it shares data in a decentralized and transactional way. The utilize of BC could support the healthcare division to adjust the accessibility, privacy, and security of PHRs. This document suggests a BC framework to efficiently and securely collect and keep health records.

Data aggregation is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor networks, which reduces the amount of data transmission between nodes by merging similar data and simplifying redundant data, thus significantly reducing the computation cost and communication overhead of the system. Many data aggregation schemes have been developed for the smart grid in the past years. However, most of the data aggregation schemes ignore the data security and privacy protection issues of the edge layer. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose an edge blockchain assisted lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation for smart grid, named EBDA. In this work, we integrate edge computing and blockchain to design a three-layer architecture data aggregation scheme for smart grid. This new architecture supports a two-level data aggregation scheme, which is more efficient and secure.

However, the poor implementation of access control of educational data produced by the IoT devices has brought students' and teachers' privacy into danger. Attackers can access educational data that they are not permitted to access and even erase the records during access. To tackle this problem, we employ blockchain technology to guarantee the integrity of access control rules and trace the records of access events. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the data produced by IoT devices. The scheme consists of three components: (1) a well-implemented data collection module that is deployed in smart classrooms, which collects and uploads data about the real-time situation inside the smart classroom to the data center; (2) a MongoDB-based data center and its control module that makes access control decisions based on the verification of the permissions of visitors, where the permissions are managed by blockchain; and (3) a customized blockchain system that stores and keeps security policy updates of the role-based access control module and records access events in a trusted way. Our analysis indicates that the proposed access control scheme guarantees the correctness of the access control process and makes the access of collected educational data auditable and responsible. Our system collectively analyzes the context of the smart classroom and is capable of detecting multiple scenarios such as absence, lateness, and gunshot. We show how the scheme preserves students' and teachers' privacy by carrying out extensive experimental studies.

By integrating with blockchain technology, we could extend the model's capabilities by presenting transparency in logic execution and integrity in data storage.

Due to distributed nature of blockchain, any new updating request needs to be reflected in all network's peers before proceeding to the subsequence requests. This process produces delay and possibility in request rejection due to update conflict. In addition, data removal is no longer feasible since each record is protected by immutable hashed link. To overcome these limitations, the integration model of blockchain and message queue is proposed in this paper.

Health data are usually collected from edge-based Internet of medical things (IoMT) with devices such as smart wearable devices, smart watches, and smartphones. Since health data are highly private and have great financial value, adversaries ceaselessly launch diverse attacks to obtain private information. All these issues pose great challenges to health data sharing in edge-based IoMT scenarios. Existing research either lacks comprehensive consideration of privacy and security protection or fails to provide a proper incentive mechanism, which expels users from sharing data. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted data sharing scheme, which allows secure and privacy-preserving profile matching. A bloom filter with hash functions is designed to verify the authenticity of keyword ciphertext. Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithm and smart contracts are employed to achieve secure profile matching. To incentivize users actively participating in profile matching, we devise an incentive mechanism and construct a two-phase Stackelberg game to address pricing problems for data owners and accessing problems of data requesters. The optimal pricing mechanism is specially designed for encouraging more users to participate in health data sharing and maximizing users’ profit. Moreover, security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol is capable of satisfying various security goals, while performance evaluation shows high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme in edge-based IoMT scenarios.

Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others. From the performance perspective, we conduct experiments by simulating different numbers of medical institutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the scalability and performance of our scheme are practical. © 2021 Yingwen Chen et al.",,,"Chen, Yingwen (36656939000); Meng, Linghang (57219165562); Zhou, Huan (57190840986); Xue, Guangtao (7202468123)",36656939000; 57219165562; 57190840986; 7202468123,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,6685762,,,,33.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109980936&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f6685762&partnerID=40&md5=fbbef83aaf8db705ac6a555f56a0b8f0,,5G mobile communication systems; Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Internet of things; Patient treatment; Privacy by design; Remote patient monitoring; Attribute based access control; Medical institutions; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Scalability and performance; Searchable encryptions; Single point failure; Trusted third parties; Data Sharing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,2-s2.0-85109980936,,,,,,,,,,,,

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,,"Miyachi, Ken (57218929591); Mackey, Tim K.

Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud‐data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large‐data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non‐linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non‐ polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real‐time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time. © 2021 by the authors.

Current existing data analysis solutions, however, assume that the data are reliably and securely collected from different IIoT data providers, an assumption that is not always true in the real world. To address the issues, in this article we propose a privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition based on gradient descent over blockchain-based encrypted IIoT data. Specifically, we use blockchain techniques to enable IIoT data providers to reliably and securely share their data by encrypting them locally before recording them in the blockchain. We use tensor train (TT) theory to build an efficient TT-based tucker decomposition based on gradient descent that tremendously reduces the number of elements to be updated during the tucker decomposition. We utilize the massive resources of fogs and clouds to implement an efficient privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition scheme. We use homomorphic encryption to build our scheme that does complete tucker train decomposition without the involvement of users.

There is an urgent demand for a blockchain transaction scheme with privacy protection and supervision functions to ensure the security and controllability of Energy Internet transactions. In order to solve the problem that the traditional blockchain application modes are difficult to simultaneously take into account the two aspects of transaction data hiding and supervision, a privacy protection model of blockchain transaction with supervision function is proposed. It uses the probabilistic public-key encryption algorithm to realize the hiding of the true identity of the blockchain transaction users, and uses the commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof technology to realize the privacy protection of the transaction amounts. With the use of identity-based encryption, the supervision of blockchain transactions is realized by regulators, which greatly reduces the pressure on storage, computing and key management.

However, sharing data poses challenges around privacy and accessibility, particularly in the event of disputes between stakeholders with a shared interest, such as a supply chain. Auditors currently rely on stakeholders' compliance in order to verify data. Malicious parties may falsify the data before passing it onto the auditor. Using supply chains as a case study we present BlockTorrent, a protocol to address these challenges and help facilitate data sharing between supply chain participants. BlockTorrent allows participants to securely share their data in near real-time with other participants without the risk of information leakage or allowing the falsification of data, whilst guaranteeing data availability for auditors. This is achieved using a novel combination of distributed storage and on-chain secret sharing. This paper provides an implementation and evaluation of BlockTorrent, highlighting its performance and a security discussion.

Recently, blockchain has gained extensive attention with its prominent characteristics as public, distributed, decentration and chronological characteristics. However, the transaction information on the blockchain is open to all nodes, the transaction information update operation is even more transparent. And the leakage of transaction information will cause huge losses to the transaction party. In response to these problems, this paper combines hierarchical attribute encryption with linear secret sharing, and proposes a blockchain data privacy protection control scheme based on searchable attribute encryption, which solves the privacy exposure problem in traditional blockchain transactions. The user's access control is implemented by the verification nodes, which avoids the security risks of submitting private keys and access structures to the blockchain network. Associating the private key component with the random identity of the user node in the blockchain can solve the collusion problem. In addition, authorized users can quickly search and supervise transaction information through searchable encryption. The improved algorithm ensures the security of keywords. Finally, based on the DBDH hypothesis, the security of the scheme is proved in the random prediction model. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

But here the question of trust arises as the data will go through many phases for the analysis by different parties. The data may contain some sensitive or private information that can be miss utilized by the organizations involved in the analysis stages. So it is needed for the hour to consider the data privacy issues very seriously. Data privacy refers to how to control the use of a piece of data by its relative importance. For example, someone will not hesitate to say his/her name to strangers but will not share mobile no. address until the stranger becomes familiar. In this digital age, the personal use of data privacy generally applied to critical personal information. From a business point of view, data privacy operates in a broader sense beyond the critical information of employees customers. There is a general conclusion that AI Machine Learning driven technologies are obstructed by data privacy issues as the ML uses large data sets to train test. But can the obstacle block convert to a stepping stone? Yes, It can be. Imagine a scenario where no one is trust-able, so in that case, Blockchain enters the scene.

Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for integrity and privacy-preserving IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing technologies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial data. Moreover, access to user data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, users' data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution also conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Lastly, we present a system of reward in the form of a digital token “PrivyCoin” for the users for sharing their data with the stakeholders/third parties.

Specifically in our framework, patients' medical records are encrypted and stored in hospital databases, where strict access controls are enforced with attribute based encryption coupled with privacy level classification. Our framework leverages blockchain technology to connect scattered private databases from participating hospitals for efficient and secure data provision, smart contracts to enable the business logic of clinical data usage, and software defined networking to revoke sharing privileges.

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties.

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing.

Smart meters face serious security challenges, such as a trusted third party or a trusted authority being attacked, which leads to the disclosure of user privacy. Blockchain provides a viable solution that can use its key technologies to solve this problem. Blockchain is a new type of decentralized protocol that does not require a trusted third party or a central authority. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized privacy-preserving data aggregation (DPPDA) scheme for smart grid based on blockchain. In this scheme, the leader election algorithm is used to select a smart meter in the residential area as a mining node to build a block. The node adopts Paillier cryptosystem algorithm to aggregate the user’s power consumption data. Boneh-Lynn-Shacham short signature and SHA-256 function are applied to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, which is convenient for billing and power regulation. The scheme protects user privacy data while achieving decentralization, without relying on TTP or CA. Security analysis shows that our scheme meets the security and privacy requirements of smart grid data aggregation.

Yet, customers have become reluctant to share data due to privacy concerns. From a psychological perspective, a reduction of users' perceived risks should result in a higher willingness to share sensitive data. The development of blockchain-supported, multi-part computation thereby represents an interesting novel empirical context to study such willingness to disclose personal data, as such technologies involve a privacy-preserving approach that could not only technically solve privacy issues but also ought to address precisely the user's risk perception. Therefore, we conducted an online experiment with 420 participants to examine the willingness to disclose personal data dependent on different privacy protection mechanisms. A deception based experiment allowed to measure not only user intention, but also real user behavior. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that participants shared similar amounts of personal data for blockchain-supported approaches and standard privacy policies. Even though an aversion to the blockchain system due to its novelty and potentially perceived complexity was not detected. Furthermore, we found that the willingness to share data increased significantly specifically for technically affine people when they were presented with the opportunity to monetize their data.

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost. © 2019 IEEE.",,,"Jiang, Shan (57189240747); Cao, Jiannong (7403354073); McCann, Julie A.

While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing 'smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party afterschool intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts.

They provide a convenient way to collect patient data, but they also bring serious problems which are mainly reflected in the safe storage of the collected data. The privacy and security of data storage in WBAN devices cannot meet the needs of WBAN users. Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user’s data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN. In addition, the new signature scheme can also compress the size of the blockchain storage space. © 2019 by the authors.

The VANET has been used to improve driving safety and construct an ITS in modern cities. However, owing to the wireless characteristics, the message transmitted through the network can be observed, altered, or forged. Since driving safety is a major part of VANET, the security and privacy of these messages must be preserved. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient privacy-preserving data transmission architecture that makes use of blockchain technology in cluster-based VANET. The cluster-based VANET architecture is used to achieve load balancing and minimize overhead in the network, where the clustering process is performed using the rainfall optimization algorithm (ROA). The ROA-based clustering with blockchain-based data transmission, called a ROAC-B technique, initially clusters the vehicles, and communication takes place via blockchain technology. A sequence of experiments was conducted to ensure the superiority of the ROAC-B technique, and several aspects of the results were considered. The simulation outcome showed that the ROAC-B technique is superior to other techniques in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), end to end (ETE) delay, throughput, and cluster size. © 2020 by the authors.

Then, we formulate the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating privacy-preserved federated learning. The privacy of data is well-maintained by sharing the data model instead of revealing the actual data. Finally, we integrate federated learning in the consensus process of permissioned blockchain, so that the computing work for consensus can also be used for federated training.

In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model.

Because of the lack of a fair exchange mechanism, most security operation centers (SOCs) are unwilling to share their real-time DDoS data. In this article, we propose a decentralized DDoS data exchange platform, namely SOChain, using blockchain technology to overcome the trust and fairness issues.

On one side the general availability of the data is vital in emergency situations and supports heavily the different research, population health management and development activities, on the other side using the same data can lead to serious social and ethical problems caused by malicious actors. Currently, the regulation of the privacy data varies all over the world, however underlying principles are always defensive and protective towards patient privacy against general availability. The protective principles cause a defensive, data hiding attitude of the health system developers to avoid breaching the overall law regulations. It makes the policy makers and different - primarily drug - developers to find ways to treat data such a way that lead to ethical and political debates. In our paper we introduce how the blockchain technology can help solving the problem of secure data storing and ensuring data availability at the same time.

Individuals can transact in an anonymous but transparent manner. Their identities remain hidden but the records of their transactions are publicly available. This has had its benefits in certain application areas but might not be suited for transactions where it is important to know who you are dealing with and in circumstances where the data in the blockchain might be confidential. Private blockchain networks are better suited for such transactions as only authorized users can transact on the network. Sensitive data can also be stored on the blockchain as it is possible to restrict the users that can see the details of the transactions. This paper describes how to create a private blockchain network and how other users can join the network. It also details the benefits of using a private blockchain network with regards to data privacy as opposed to a public network. © 2020 IEEE.,,,"Ncube, Tyron (57222042117); Dlodlo, Nomusa (55887226400); Terzoli, Alfredo (35605696100)",57222042117; 55887226400; 35605696100,"2020 2nd International Multidisciplinary Information Technology and Engineering Conference, IMITEC 2020",9334132,,,,7.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101130371&doi=10.1109%2fIMITEC50163.2020.9334132&partnerID=40&md5=db01bdf2698231956daffe4a4012a002,Blockchain; Ethereum; Privacy; Proof-of-Authority,Privacy by design; Application area; Authorized users; Digital world; Public networks; Sensitive datas; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85101130371,,,,,,,,,,,,

An example of these risks is the presence of a third party between users and various services, which leads to the collection and control of large amounts of users' personal information and the possibility of their databases being misused or hacked. Blockchain technology and encrypted currencies have so far shown that a decentralized network of peer-to-peer users, along with a general ledger, can do reliable computing. So, in this article, we are going to introduce a protocol that converts the blockchain network to an automated access control manager without the presence of a third party. To this end, we designed a mutual authentication protocol to create a secure channel between the user and the service and then demonstrate its accuracy and completeness using the Gong-Nidham-Yahalom belief logic [1]. The results of our evaluations show that our proposed protocol is secure enough to be used on the blockchain network and attackers are unable to penetrate, track, impersonate, inject, misrepresent or distort information using the common attacks. © 2020 MECS.",,,"Mohammadinejad, Hossein (57217067344); Mohammadhoseini, Fateme (57217066471)",57217067344; 57217066471,International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security,,44.0,52.0,8.0,8.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086047025&doi=10.5815%2fijcnis.2020.03.05&partnerID=40&md5=8ba29966b1015849e207453b858501dd,Access Control; Authentication Protocol; Blockchain; Decentralized Personal Data Management; Privacy; Secure Channel,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,2-s2.0-85086047025,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model maintains a reliable medical ledger database based on the decoupling of blockchain, ensuring that the privacy data cannot be tampered. It constructs a private data storage protocol based on ring signature, which guarantees medical data and patient identity privacy with its full anonymity. We proposed a medical information strict access control management mechanism based on smart contract automation execution of preset instructions.

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts.

It can lead to many research opportunities and business innovations. Academia and industry proposed many blockchain based software solutions within a wide range of domains. In this paper we present a system design where blockchain technology is proposed to be used in the healthcare system, where the vital information regarding the medical analyses are shared between hospitals, medical clinics and research institutes based on access policies defined by the patients. In order to protect confidential data, our solution involves the use of two types of chains: a private one, the sidechain, which keeps information about real ID of the patients, and a public one, the mainchain, which stores information about patients' health data marked with a temporary ID. To test it, we developed the design using Hyperledger Fabric framework. Presented experimental results show good performance of the system in relation to the following metrics: 1) the time needed to identify the medical data for a particular patient, and 2) the mainchain propagation time of all the blocks within the peer to peer network. © 2019 IEEE.",,,"Hirtan, Liviu (57205670753); Krawiec, Piotr (56632203700); Dobre, Ciprian (24437773100); Batalla, Jordi Mongay (23396244300)",57205670753; 56632203700; 24437773100; 23396244300,"IEEE International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks, CAMAD",8858469,,,,29.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073796079&doi=10.1109%2fCAMAD.2019.8858469&partnerID=40&md5=12681468a9672359c6943f02ec75d68d,Blockchain; Data access management; Data privacy; E-health,Blockchain; Data privacy; eHealth; Peer to peer networks; Business innovation; Data access management; Health-care system; New business models; Privacy protection; Research institutes; Research opportunities; Software solution; Medical information systems,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85073796079,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we integrate the strengths of both blockchain and cloud computing and build the privacy protection scheme for medical data based on blockchain and cloud computing. This scheme introduces cloud computing and provides services to blockchain nodes with cloud server computing; meanwhile, it collects, analyzes, processes, and maintains medical data in the identity authentication interface and solves the insufficient computing abilities of some nodes in blockchain so as to verify the authenticity and reliability of data. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed scheme is effective.

A Fundamental Study of How Privacy-Aware Blockchains Are Feasible,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,,,,10.1145/3477314.3506986,,,,,,,,,,,,"Due to the advancing digitalization, the importance of data is constantly increasing. Application domains such as smart cars, smart cities, or smart healthcare rely on the permanent availability of large amounts of data to all parties involved. As a result, the value of data increases, making it a lucrative target for cyber-attacks. Particularly when human lives depend on the data, additional protection measures are therefore important for data management and provision. Blockchains, i. e., decentralized, immutable, and tamper-proof data stores, are becoming increasingly popular for this purpose. Yet, from a data protection perspective, the immutable and tamper-proof properties of blockchains pose a privacy concern. In this paper, we therefore investigate whether blockchains are in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if personal data are involved. To this end, we elaborate which articles of the GDPR are relevant in this regard and present technical solutions for those legal requirements with which blockchains are in conflict. We further identify open research questions that need to be addressed in order to achieve a privacy-by-design blockchain system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conference Paper,,2022.0,1218–1227,"New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the 37th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing,Virtual Event,2022,9781450387132.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3477314.3506986;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3477314.3506986,"GDPR, immutable, blockchains, tamper-proof, privacy assessment",SAC '22

This technology provides interesting properties and allows governments to develop flexible and innovative data management systems. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of using Blockchains requires understanding the government processes along with the legal framework and political setting imposed on government. Though it is a buzzword, Blockchain may not always be the best solution for data processing, and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment could allow an analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the mechanism. Furthermore, principles relating to security of data remain applicable to Blockchains.
