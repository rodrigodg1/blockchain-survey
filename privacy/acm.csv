However, data owners are reluctant to share their sensitive data to third parties for modelling in many cases. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) has arisen as an alternative to enable collaborative training of models without sharing raw data, by distributing modelling tasks to multiple data owners. Based on FL, we premodel sent a novel and decentralized approach to training encrypted models with privacy-preserved data on Blockchain. In our approach, Blockchain is adopted as the machine learning environment where different actors (i.e., the model provider, the data provider) collaborate on the training task. During the training process, an encryption algorithm is used to protect the privacy of data and the trained model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is practical in real-world applications.","Machine, Blockchain, LearningDistributed, Learning Privacy","ICVISP 2019"

Thus, novel ways to treat data, in which users are guaranteed control, usability, and privacy over their generated data are needed. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving blockchain framework for a data sharing marketplace. The proposed framework allows users (such as sensors and devices) that generate data to store it in external servers, while the blockchain is utilized to record buy and sell transactions between parties, as well as perform access control by generating access sequences whenever trades are performed. A novel perspective over data ownership is presented, in which whoever generates the data has completed ownership and control over it and the blockchain transactions are only utilized to guarantee temporary access to it. The proposed blockchain framework also supports different types of data and provides, via the distributed and openness of the framework, quality, timeliness and similarity control over the data stored in the marketplace. In this context, different types of applications that can benefit from this framework are presented and open problems are discussed.","Internet of Things, marketplace, big data, Blockchain",""

However, there is a need for privacy in medical records, and it must be able to be accessed by appropriate people in accordance with the authority. So it needs a technology like Enigma to achieve it. Enigma uses multi-party computation (hereinafter referred to as MPC) and distributed hash-table (hereinafter referred to as DHT) technology, combined with the blockchain to divide the data to be stored into public blocks and private parts The blockchain has an existing way of computing and storing, and private data is Enigma's method of computing and storing by using the method called Off-Chain. Only authenticated users can access private data. However, many applications have the need for group sharing and decentralized records.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.","Behavior control, smart contract, Internet of Things, blockchain",""

Searchable encryption with forward and backward privacy can better meet people’s security needs, for it leaks less information. However, only forward and backward is not enough to deal with the situation where the server returns less search results than it should. This paper will focus on this question. Since the consensus mechanism in the blockchain can well ensure honesty, this paper proposes a symmetric searchable encryption with forward and backward privacy based on blockchain smart contracts. We propose a one-to-one scheme SCSSEFB that can be easily extended to one-to-many and extended to the asymmetric case.

Specifically, our scheme takes 103 seconds in the update phase when the test data set is 16,000 bytes and the amount of keyword pairs is 50, and 142.5 seconds in the search phase when the number of keywords is 5 and the amount of leaves in the Merkle tree is 8388608.","Blockchain, Symmetric Searchable Encryption, Forward and Backward Privacy, Smart Contract","BSCI '23"

Collection of fine-grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks associated with fine-grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy of users.

However, provenance graphs have the graph structure containing sensitive information including the records as well as the linkages between the records. Both need to be kept secret from the unauthorized users including the blockchain peers. Storing the record linkages on blockchain in a privacy-preserving manner is challenging because (1) past records cannot be modified due to the tamper-proofness, (2) efficient graph tracking/tracing on blockchain is necessary for a provenance system on blockchain, and (3) the size of the records' pointer may leak the volume of linkages. Existing approaches either fail to provide linkage privacy protection to the provenance graph, could only support less-complicated structure such as tree, or leak the volume of linkages from the block sizes. We present Trac2Chain, a framework that provides complete linkage privacy as well as full tracking/tracing functions for the provenance graphs stored on blockchain. The novel graph storage design in Trac2Chain allows generation of the provenance dependencies of arbitrary graph structure while still enjoying the tamper-proofness of blockchain.

Secure multi-party computation, as a technology paradigm based on cryptography technology, enables privacy protection in data sharing among multiple parties, while the implement of secure multi-party computation is limited due to the inefficient, complex computation protocol and frequent interaction. Fortunately, the emergence of blockchain technology provides excellent properties of decentralization, verifiability and high reliability for secure multi-party computation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based secure multi-party computation architecture for data sharing, where we design an aggregator consortium for data storage, verification and joint computation. Moreover, we introduce a straightforward secure multi-party computation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. In addition, we analyze and discuss this scheme in terms of data security, access flexibility, attack resistance and potential applications.","Privacy protection, Homomorphic encryption, Blockchain, Secure multi-party computation","ICBCT'20"

Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.","Privacy, Blockchain Cloud, Blockchain, Data provenance, Reliability, Cloud Computing","CCGrid '17"
