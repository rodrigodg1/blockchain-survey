"Zyskind G., Nathan O., Pentland A.S.",Decentralizing privacy: Using blockchain to protect personal data,10.1109/SPW.2015.27,2015,Personal Data,Public Key Encryption,N/A,N/A,1538,"The recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users' privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data. Bit coin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a block chain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bit coin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial - they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to block chains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.

Sharing of healthcare data is one essential step to make healthcare system smarter and improve the quality of healthcare service. Healthcare data, one personal asset of patient, should be owned and controlled by patient, instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems, which prevents data sharing and puts patient privacy at risks. Blockchain is demonstrated in the financial field that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we proposed an App (called Healthcare Data Gateway (HGD)) architecture based on blockchain to enable patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating privacy, which provides a new potential way to improve the intelligence of healthcare systems while keeping patient data private. Our proposed purpose-centric access model ensures patient own and control their healthcare data; simple unified Indicator-Centric Schema (ICS) makes it possible to organize all kinds of personal healthcare data practically and easily. We also point out that MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computing) is one promising solution to enable untrusted third-party to conduct computation over patient data without violating privacy.",Journal of Medical Systems,40,10,218,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984636595&doi=10.1007%2fs10916-016-0574-6&partnerID=40&md5=91aad6f91806b3f191d93f3baa20d303,"School of Political Science and Public Administration, Huaqiao University, No.269 Chenghua North Rd.

Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.","Proceedings - 2017 17th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing, CCGRID 2017",,,7973733,468,477,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023758316&doi=10.1109%2fCCGRID.2017.8&partnerID=40&md5=f39b7fe8c56f80410745e209de80959e,"College of Engineering, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN  37209, United States; Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA  23529, United States; Department of Computer Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA  23504, United States; Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY  13441, United States","Liang, X., College of Engineering, Tennessee State University, Nashville, TN  37209, United States; Shetty, S., Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA  23529, United States; Tosh, D., Department of Computer Science, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, VA  23504, United States; Kamhoua, C., Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY  13441, United States; Kwiat, K., Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY  13441, United States; Njilla, L., Cyber Assurance Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome, NY  13441, United States",Blockchain; Blockchain Cloud; Cloud Computing; Data provenance; Privacy; Reliability,Architecture; Availability; Cloud computing; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Grid computing; Reliability; Block-chain; Cloud data provenances; Cloud environments; Data accountabilities; Data collection; Data provenance; Design and implements; Security features; Data privacy,,,,,"Simmhan, Y.L., Plale, B., Gannon, D., A survey of data provenance in e-science (2005) ACM Sigmod Record, 34 (3), pp. 31-36; Lee, B., Awad, A., Awad, M., Towards secure provenance in the cloud: A survey (2015) 2015 IEEE/ACM 8th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)., pp. 577-582. , IEEE; Tosh, D., Sengupta, S., Kamhoua, C.A., Kwiat, K.A., Establishing evolutionary game models for cyber security information exchange (cybex) (2016) Journal of Computer and System Sciences; Kamhoua, C., Martin, A., Tosh, D.K., Kwiat, K., Heitzenrater, C., Sengupta, S., Cyber-Threats information sharing in cloud computing: A game theoretic approach (2015) IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud, pp. 382-389; Tosh, D.K., Sengupta, S., Mukhopadhyay, S., Kamhoua, C., Kwiat, K., Game theoretic modeling to enforce security information sharing among firms (2015) IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud, pp. 7-12; Tosh, D.K., Molloy, M., Sengupta, S., Kamhoua, C.A., Kwiat, K.A., Cyber-investment and cyber-information exchange decision modeling (2015) IEEE 7th Intl.

"Liu J., Li X., Ye L., Zhang H., Du X., Guizani M.",BPDS: A Blockchain Based Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing for Electronic Medical Records,10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647713,2018,Healthcare,Public Key Encryption and CP-ABE-based access control ,N/A,N/A,122,"Electronic medical record (EMR) is a crucial form of healthcare data, currently drawing a lot of attention. Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.","2018 IEEE Global Communications Conference, GLOBECOM 2018 - Proceedings",,,8647713,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063464219&doi=10.1109%2fGLOCOM.2018.8647713&partnerID=40&md5=f910913fc9dee414d13cf672e8289a7e,"State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, 710071, China;

"Zhang A., Lin X.",Towards Secure and Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in e-Health Systems via Consortium Blockchain,10.1007/s10916-018-0995-5,2018,Healthcare,Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) ,Ethereum,N/A,271,"Electronic health record sharing can help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, where security and privacy preservation are critical issues in the systems. In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients’ identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance.

"Makhdoom I., Zhou I., Abolhasan M., Lipman J., Ni W.",PrivySharing: A blockchain-based framework for privacy-preserving and secure data sharing in smart cities,10.1016/j.cose.2019.101653,2020,Internet of Things (IoT),Data Encryption and Hyperledger Fabric Channels,Hyperledger Fabric,N/A,110,"The ubiquitous use of Internet of Things (IoT) ranges from industrial control systems to e-Health, e-commerce, smart cities, agriculture, supply chain management, smart cars, cyber-physical systems and a lot more. However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system.",Computers and Security,88,,101653,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074150487&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2019.101653&partnerID=40&md5=e2b5ea708ccdab330f4b4a19f6df596c,"University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Food Agility CRC Ltd, University of Technology Sydney, Australia; Data61-CSIRO, Australia","Makhdoom, I., University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Zhou, I., University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Abolhasan, M., University of Technology, Sydney, Australia; Lipman, J., Food Agility CRC Ltd, University of Technology Sydney, Australia; Ni, W., Data61-CSIRO, Australia",Blockchain; EU GDPR Compliance; Internet of Things; Security and privacy; Smart city,Access control; Application programming interfaces (API); Blockchain; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Network security; Smart city; Supply chain management; Centralized control; General data protection regulations; Industrial control systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Single channels; Various Channels; Data privacy,,,,,"Abdelwahab, S., Hamdaoui, B., Guizani, M., Znati, T., Replisom: disciplined tiny memory replication for massive IoT devices in LTE edge cloud (2016) IoT J., 3 (3), pp. 327-338; Ahmad, I., Kumar, T., Liyanage, M., Okwuibe, J., Ylianttila, M., Gurtov, A., Overview of 5G security challenges and solutions (2018) Commun.

Data aggregation is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor networks, which reduces the amount of data transmission between nodes by merging similar data and simplifying redundant data, thus significantly reducing the computation cost and communication overhead of the system. Many data aggregation schemes have been developed for the smart grid in the past years. However, most of the data aggregation schemes ignore the data security and privacy protection issues of the edge layer. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose an edge blockchain assisted lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation for smart grid, named EBDA. In this work, we integrate edge computing and blockchain to design a three-layer architecture data aggregation scheme for smart grid. This new architecture supports a two-level data aggregation scheme, which is more efficient and secure. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, EBDA shows great superiority in terms of resisting network attacks, reducing system computation costs and communication overhead compared with existing schemes.",IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,18,2,9312167,1246,1259,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099080580&doi=10.1109%2fTNSM.2020.3048822&partnerID=40&md5=2c080a2d97c9fb1529df8df77cd86b27,"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; College of IoT, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China","Lu, W., Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Ren, Z., Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Xu, J., Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Chen, S., College of IoT, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China",blockchain; data aggregation; Edge computing; smart grid,Blockchain; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Network architecture; Privacy by design; Sensor nodes; Analysis and simulation; Communication overheads; Computation costs; Data security and privacy; Privacy preserving; Reducing systems; Threelayer architecture; Traditional power system; Smart power grids,,,,,"Fadlullah, Z.M., Fouda, M.M., Kato, N., Takeuchi, A., Iwasaki, N., Nozaki, Y., Toward intelligent machine-to-machine communications in smart grid (2011) Ieee Commun.

Current solutions include symmetric encryption and access controls to secure the data transfer, but they have some drawbacks such as a single point of failure. Blockchain is a promising distributed ledger technology that can prevent the malicious tampering of data, offering reliable data storage. This paper proposes a distributed access control system based on blockchain technology to secure IoT data. The proposed mechanism is based on fog computing and the concept of the alliance chain. This method uses mixed linear and nonlinear spatiotemporal chaotic systems (MLNCML) and the least significant bit (LSB) to encrypt the IoT data on an edge node and then upload the encrypted data to the cloud. The proposed mechanism can solve the problem of a single point of failure of access control by providing the dynamic and fine-grained access control for IoT data. The experimental results of this method demonstrated that it can protect the privacy of IoT data efficiently.",Cluster Computing,24,2,,1331,1345,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092670092&doi=10.1007%2fs10586-020-03190-3&partnerID=40&md5=857f232cb5cfce88bcc4bc91f96b6574,"Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Trusted Computing, Beijing, 100124, China","Liu, Y., Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China, Beijing Key Laboratory of Trusted Computing, Beijing, 100124, China; Zhang, J., Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China, Beijing Key Laboratory of Trusted Computing, Beijing, 100124, China; Zhan, J., Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, 100124, China, Beijing Key Laboratory of Trusted Computing, Beijing, 100124, China",Access control; Blockchain; Cloud storage; Data privacy; IoT,Access control; Blockchain; Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Fog computing; Network security; Distributed access controls; Insecure networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Least significant bits; Privacy breaches; Privacy protection; Spatiotemporal chaotic systems; Symmetric encryption; Internet of things,,,,,"Stoyanova, M., Nikoloudakis, Y., Panagiotakis, S., Pallis, E., Markakis, E.K., A survey on the internet of things (IoT) forensics: challenges, approaches and open issues (2020) IEEE Commun.

The IoT is deployed in the system in a centralized manner. At the same time that massive data has put a certain amount of pressure on the storage, the open network environment has not fully protected the privacy of the IoT data, which has become one of the important factors restricting the development of the IoT. Blockchain is a point-to-point distributed ledger technology based on cryptographic algorithms. The characteristics of decentralization, tamper resistance, anonymity, and public verifiability can alleviate data security issues in IoT. Ring signature and proxy reencryption are common encryption technologies in the field of privacy protection. Therefore, this article combines blockchain technology with ring signature and proxy reencryption to propose a privacy protection solution for the IoT. Through this solution, the data authorized for sharing in the IoT is transmitted in the system in the form of ciphertext, the identity information of the data sender is protected, and the distributed ledger eases the pressure of mass data storage on a centralized server. The correctness and safety of the proposed scheme are also analyzed.",Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,32,5,e4010,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087673941&doi=10.1002%2fett.4010&partnerID=40&md5=16b9257623109ed101555922314ca085,"Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; School of Modern Posts and Institute of Modern Posts, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Logistics Information Technology, YTO Express Company Ltd, Shanghai, China; School of Computer Information Engineering, Changzhou Institute of Technology, Changzhou, China","Gong, J., Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, School of Modern Posts and Institute of Modern Posts, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Mei, Y., Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, School of Modern Posts and Institute of Modern Posts, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Xiang, F., National Engineering Laboratory for Logistics Information Technology, YTO Express Company Ltd, Shanghai, China; Hong, H., Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, School of Modern Posts and Institute of Modern Posts, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China; Sun, Y., School of Computer Information Engineering, Changzhou Institute of Technology, Changzhou, China; Sun, Z., Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, School of Modern Posts and Institute of Modern Posts, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China",,Authentication; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Centralized server; Cryptographic algorithms; Data privacy protections; Encryption technologies; Identity information; Internet of thing (IOT); Proxy re encryptions; Public verifiability; Internet of things,,,,,"Ashton, K., That 'Internet of Things' Thing (2009) RFID J, 22 (7), pp. 97-114; (2005), ITU internet reports 2005 the Internet of Things; Jamali, M.A.J., Bahrami, B., Heidari, A., (2020), IoT security towards the Internet of Things; Al-Doghman, F., Chaczko, Z., Jiang, J., (2017), A review of aggrega- tion algorithms for the Internet of Things.

To ensure the safe sharing of resources in IIoT, this paper proposes a data security sharing model based on privacy protection (DSS-PP) for blockchain-enabled IIoT. Compared with previous works, DSS-PP has obvious advantages in several important aspects: (1) In the process of identity authentication, it protects users' personal information by using authentication technology with hidden attributes; (2) the encrypted shared resources are stored in off-chain database of the blockchain, while only the ciphertext index information is stored in the block. It reduces the storage load of the blockchain; (3) it uses blockchain logging technology to trace and account for illegal access. Under the hardness assumption of Inverse Computational Diffe–Hellman (ICDH) problem, this model is proven to be correct and safe.

Due to cybersecurity attacks and threats, data aggregation operations in a smart grid are challenging. The majority of existing techniques have high computation and communication costs and are still vulnerable to various security and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a deep learning and homomorphic encryption-based privacy-preserving data aggregation model to mitigate the negative impact of a flash workload on the accuracy of prediction models. The model also ensures a secure data aggregation process with low computational overhead. The proposed model is 80% more effective than the traditional approach in detecting smart meter manipulation, and the computation cost is 20% to 80% less than existing techniques. Thus, the proposed blockchain and homomorphic encryption-based data aggregation (BHDA) scheme shows a significant improvement in performance and privacy preservation with minimal computation overhead for data aggregation in smart grids.",Computers and Electrical Engineering,93,,107209,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107640686&doi=10.1016%2fj.compeleceng.2021.107209&partnerID=40&md5=7d9503d345f83fb2cd72860d8017465d,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Lovely Professional University, India; Department of Computer Science, College of Computers and Information Technology, Taif University, P.O.

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust.",Information Processing and Management,58,3,102535,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100242135&doi=10.1016%2fj.ipm.2021.102535&partnerID=40&md5=d6a852a8046ba8c424528d216c5da72d,"BlockLAB, San Diego Supercomputer Center, San Diego, CA, United States; IEEE, San Diego Chapter, San Diego, CA, United States; Department of Anesthesiology and Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, University of California, San Diego – School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States; Global Health Policy Institute, San Diego, CA, United States; University of California, San Diego – Extension, San Diego, CA, United States; S-3 Research LLC, San Diego, CA, United States","Miyachi, K., BlockLAB, San Diego Supercomputer Center, San Diego, CA, United States, IEEE, San Diego Chapter, San Diego, CA, United States; Mackey, T.K., BlockLAB, San Diego Supercomputer Center, San Diego, CA, United States, Department of Anesthesiology and Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, University of California, San Diego – School of Medicine, San Diego, CA, United States, Global Health Policy Institute, San Diego, CA, United States, University of California, San Diego – Extension, San Diego, CA, United States, S-3 Research LLC, San Diego, CA, United States",Blockchain; Data storage; Distributed ledger technology; Health informatics; Healthcare; Privacy; Secure computation,Blockchain; Digital storage; Health care; Privacy by design; Research and development management; Systems analysis; Distributed software architecture; Healthcare industry; Information management systems; Information processing and management; Legal requirements; Privacy preserving; Reference models; Research and development; Information management,,,,,"Hasselgren, A., Kralevska, K., Gligoroski, D., Pedersen, S.A., Faxvaag, A., Blockchain in healthcare and health sciences—A scoping review (2020) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 134; Abraham, R., Schneider, J., Brocke, J., Data governance: A conceptual framework, structured review, and research agenda (2019) International Journal of Information Management, 49, pp. 424-438; Agha, L., The effects of health information technology on the costs and quality of medical care (2014) Journal of Health Economics, 34, pp. 19-30; Andoni, M., Robu, V., Flynn, D., Abram, S., Geach, D., Jenkins, D., Blockchain technology in the energy sector: A systematic review of challenges and opportunities (2019) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 100, pp. 143-174; Atzori, M., Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance: Is the State Still Necessary?

Recently, blockchain-based eHealth systems have achieved great success in terms of EMRs sharing and management, but there still remain some challenges. Permissioned blockchain-based solutions provide high throughput and scalability, but may suffer from rollback attacks and lead to privacy leakage. Designs based on the public blockchain, on the other hand, are more open and secure, but sacrifice scalability and have no incentives for medical institutions to join into the systems. Moreover, data retrieval in blockchain-based eHealth systems is inefficient because of the basic blockchain structure. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing and privacy-preserving eHealth system named SPChain. To achieve quick retrieval, we devise special keyblocks and microblocks for patients to store their EMRs. A reputation system is also constructed to motivate medical institutions to participate in SPChain. By using proxy re-encryption schemes, SPChain achieves medical data sharing for patients in a privacy-preserving manner. To evaluate SPChain, we leverage the distribution of miners in the real world to test the system's performance and ability to resist mentioned attacks. The results show that SPChain can achieve high throughput (220 TPS) with low storage overhead. Compared with the existing schemes, SPChain achieves lower time complexity in terms of data retrieving, and can resist proposed blockchain attacks as well as SPChain attacks.",Information Processing and Management,58,4,102604,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103768801&doi=10.1016%2fj.ipm.2021.102604&partnerID=40&md5=ec1dd341d5d9d9b9e7e929fa4020b389,"School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, 710071, China","Zou, R., School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, 710071, China; Lv, X., School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, 710071, China; Zhao, J., School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, 710071, China",Blockchain; Data sharing; Electronic medical record; Privacy; Reputation system,Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; eHealth; Medical computing; Scalability; Search engines; Block-chain; Data Sharing; e-Health systems; High-throughput; Medical data; Medical institutions; Medical record; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Reputation systems; Blockchain,,,,,"Apostolaki, M., Zohar, A., Vanbever, L., Hijacking bitcoin: Routing attacks on cryptocurrencies (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 375-392. , IEEE; Ateniese, G., Magri, B., Venturi, D., Andrade, E., Redactable blockchain–or–rewriting history in bitcoin and friends (2017) 2017 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), pp. 111-126. , IEEE; Azaria, A., Ekblaw, A., Vieira, T., Lippman, A., Medrec: Using blockchain for medical data access and permission management (2016) 2016 2nd International Conference on Open and Big Data (OBD), pp. 25-30. , IEEE; Berdik, D., Otoum, S., Schmidt, N., Porter, D., Jararweh, Y., A survey on blockchain for information systems management and security (2021) Information Processing & Management, 58 (1); Bernabe, J.B., Canovas, J.L., Hernandez-Ramos, J.L., Moreno, R.T., Skarmeta, A., Privacy-preserving solutions for blockchain: Review and challenges (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 164908-164940; Bessani, A., Sousa, J., Alchieri, E.E., State machine replication for the masses with BFT-SMART (2014) 2014 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, pp. 355-362. , IEEE; Boneh, D., Di Crescenzo, G., Ostrovsky, R., Persiano, G., Public key encryption with keyword search (2004) International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, pp. 506-522. , Springer; Bonneau, J., Why buy when you can rent?

"Piao C., Hao Y., Yan J., Jiang X.",Privacy preserving in blockchain-based government data sharing: A Service-On-Chain (SOC) approach,10.1016/j.ipm.2021.102651,2021,Government,Smart Contracts to Validate Permission Settings,Hyperledger Fabric ,N/A,7,"Sharing government data is of great significance to social development, but insecure and inappropriate sharing may lead to privacy breaches. Data sharing in consortium blockchain has provided a promising direction for efficient privacy preserving government data sharing. However, since government data is not owned by a single person or any government employers, it is hard to attribute participants’ responsibility for motivating data sharing behavior in blockchain systems. Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach. The SOC approach can effectively identify different departments’ data retrieving requirements while efficiently sharing government data with trustworthiness in data content and controllability in data ownership. In particular, we utilize smart contracts to provide an onchain service to define data sharing agreements between government departments, which can identify ambiguous data retrieving requirements and formalize the process logic. We apply the SOC approach to a real world scenario and demonstrate that the SOC approach provides a feasible solution for secure and efficient sharing of data among government departments.",Information Processing and Management,58,5,102651,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110028674&doi=10.1016%2fj.ipm.2021.102651&partnerID=40&md5=35f4dc0f62372cb93c1aa1cd5de0e604,"Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050043, China; Nanjing University, School of Information Management, Nanjing, 210023, China; Construction Information Center, Hebei Province Department of Housing & Urban-Rural Development, Shijiazhuang, 050043, China","Piao, C., Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050043, China; Hao, Y., Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, School of Information Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, 050043, China; Yan, J., Nanjing University, School of Information Management, Nanjing, 210023, China; Jiang, X., Construction Information Center, Hebei Province Department of Housing & Urban-Rural Development, Shijiazhuang, 050043, China",Consortium blockchain; Government data sharing; Privacy preserving; Smart contract,Data privacy; Data Sharing; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Data Sharing; Government data sharing; Government departments; Privacy breaches; Privacy preserving; Shared data; Smart contract; Social development; Blockchain,,,,,"Berdik, D., Otoum, S., Schmidt, N., Porter, D., Jararweh, Y., A survey on blockchain for information systems management and security (2021) Information Processing and Management, 58 (1); Campanile, L., Iacono, M., Marulli, F., Mastroianni, M., Designing a GDPR compliant blockchain-based iov distributed information tracking system (2021) Information Processing and Management, 58 (3); Chen, Q., Research on cross-sectoral government information sharing and negotiation system-based on metadata (2014) Journal of Intelligence, 33 (7), pp. 183-199; Cheng, X., On ownership of data inthe blockchain (2020) Modern Law Science, 42 (2), pp. 121-132; Choong-Sik, C., Sung-Bou, K., A comparative study of digital government policies, focusing on E-government acts in Korea and the United States (2019) Electronics, 11; Clarke, C., Stuart, K., Reducing the impact of cyberthreats with robust data governance (2016) Computer Fraud and Security, 2016 (7), pp. 12-15; CNCERT/CC, C., China Internet network security report in 2019 (2020), The People's Posts and Telecommunications Press; Dong, L., Li, Y., Research on the construction of government affairs data information sharing platform based on cloud computing—Taking “digital fujian” as an example (2015) Journal of Modern Information, 35 (10), pp. 76-81; Engin, Z., Treleaven, P., Algorithmic government: Automating public services and supporting civil servants in using data science technologies (2019) Computer Journal, 62 (3), pp. 448-460; Esposito, C., Ficco, M., Gupta, B.B., Blockchain-based authentication and authorization for smart city applications (2021) Information Processing and Management, 58 (2); Ewa, Z., Tomasz, P., Rafal, Z., Maria, J.-H., Factors Influencing the success of e-government (2016) Journal of Computer Information Systems, 56 (2), pp. 156-167; Gao, G., Gong, Z., Li, Y., Study on cooperative sharing mode of government basic information based on blockchain (2018) E-Government, (2), pp. 15-25; Geneiatakis, D., Soupionis, Y., Steri, G., Kounelis, I., Neisse, R., Fovino, I.N., Blockchain performance analysis for supporting cross-border E-government services (2020) IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 67 (4), pp. 1310-1322; Gong, X., Peng, K., Unveiling the government's big data application (2015), China Science Daily; Hao, Y., Piao, C., Zhao, Y., Jiang, X., Privacy preserving government data sharing based on hyperledger blockchain (2019) Advances in e-business engineering for ubiquitous computing, Lecture notes on data engineering and communications technologies, 41, pp. 389-404. , Chao K.

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices.

As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this paper, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that MedShare is efficient for EHR sharing.",IEEE Transactions on Services Computing,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115668819&doi=10.1109%2fTSC.2021.3114719&partnerID=40&md5=10bda4db73562ba9127251dfbe232df8,"Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: mingyue.wang@my.cityu.edu.hk); School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, 47836 Beijing, Haidian, China, 100875 (e-mail: yuguo@bnu.edu.cn); Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, 53025 Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: c.zhang@my.cityu.edu.hk); Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: congwang@cityu.edu.hk); Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: huanghejiao@hit.edu.cn); Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: csjia@cityu.edu.hk)","Wang, M., Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: mingyue.wang@my.cityu.edu.hk); Guo, Y., School of Artificial Intelligence, Beijing Normal University, 47836 Beijing, Haidian, China, 100875 (e-mail: yuguo@bnu.edu.cn); Zhang, C., Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, 53025 Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: c.zhang@my.cityu.edu.hk); Wang, C., Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, (e-mail: congwang@cityu.edu.hk); Huang, H., Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: huanghejiao@hit.edu.cn); Jia, X., Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen, 529484 Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, (e-mail: csjia@cityu.edu.hk)",attribute-based encryption; Blockchains; boolean search; Cryptography; decentralized framework; Encryption; Indexes; medical data sharing; Medical services; Searchable encryption; Servers; Smart contracts,Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Denial-of-service attack; Locks (fasteners); Medical information systems; Network security; Search engines; Attribute-based encryptions; Block-chain; Boolean search; Data Sharing; Decentralised; Decentralized framework; Index; Medical data; Medical data sharing; Medical services; Searchable encryptions; Smart contract,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,,,19391374,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

To this end, we propose PrivDA, a Privacy-preserving IoT Data Aggregation scheme based on the blockchain and homomorphic encryption technologies. In the proposed system, each data consumer can create a smart contract and publish both terms of service and requested IoT data. Thus, the smart contract puts together into one group potential data producers that can answer the consumer’s request and chooses one aggregator, the role of which is to compute the group requested result using homomorphic computations. Therefore, group-level aggregation obfuscates IoT data, which complicates sensitive information inference from a single IoT device.

However, data could be subjected to the threat of security attacks, leakage, tampering, and forgery during medical data transmissions, data storage, and sharing based on public networks and cloud environments. The immutability, decentralization and anonymity of the blockchain provided new ways for solving the aforementioned problems. This paper proposes a complete medical information system model based on blockchain technology, to realize the goal of safe storage and sharing of medical data. A data collection system based on Internet of Things (IoT) was also developed that can simultaneously collect data from different types of non-invasive medical instruments to realize real-time collection of patient health record during surgery (SHR). This system designed an anonymous medical data sharing scheme based on cloud servers and proxy re-encryption algorithm to improve the security of private medical data sharing. The system was implemented based on the permissioned blockchain architecture Hyperledger Fabric, and a dual-channel Fabric deployment architecture and medical chaincode were designed for data management and access control. We also carried out computing overhead test, performance test and safety evaluation on the system, and the test results meet the requirements of actual medical production environment. The research work of this paper provides means for remote diagnosis and treatment, data mining and other practical applications based on the medical data on the blockchain.",Future Generation Computer Systems,124,,,338,350,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108096199&doi=10.1016%2fj.future.2021.05.023&partnerID=40&md5=05f9e9cf3e3ca144782908b97f715578,"Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems Ministry of Education, Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China; International R & D Center of Micro-Nano Systems and New Materials Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China","Chen, Z., Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems Ministry of Education, Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China, International R & D Center of Micro-Nano Systems and New Materials Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China; Xu, W., Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems Ministry of Education, Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China, International R & D Center of Micro-Nano Systems and New Materials Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China; Wang, B., Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems Ministry of Education, Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China, International R & D Center of Micro-Nano Systems and New Materials Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China; Yu, H., Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems Ministry of Education, Department of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China, International R & D Center of Micro-Nano Systems and New Materials Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China",Blockchain; Hospital information system; Hyperledger fabric; Medical data collection and sharing; Proxy re-encryption algorithm,Access control; Blockchain; Data acquisition; Data mining; Data privacy; Data Sharing; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Information management; Information use; Internet of things; Medical computing; Medical information systems; Network architecture; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Hospital information systems; Hyperledg fabric; Medical data; Medical data collection and sharing; Network technologies; Proxy re-encryption algorithm; Research areas; Sharing systems; Cryptography,,,,,"Sun, S.Y., Xie, Z., Yu, K.T., Jiang, B.Q., Zheng, S.W., Pan, X.T., COVID-19 and healthcare system in China: Challenges and progression for a sustainable future (2021) Glob.

"Chen Y., Meng L., Zhou H., Xue G.",A Blockchain-Based Medical Data Sharing Mechanism with Attribute-Based Access Control and Privacy Protection,10.1155/2021/6685762,2021,Healthcare,K-anonymity and searchable encryption,Hyperledger Fabric ,Yes \cite{repo-2021-medical-data-sharing},13,"The rapid development of wearable sensors and the 5G network empowers traditional medical treatment with the ability to collect patients' information remotely for monitoring and diagnosing purposes. Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others. From the performance perspective, we conduct experiments by simulating different numbers of medical institutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the scalability and performance of our scheme are practical.",Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2021,,6685762,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109980936&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f6685762&partnerID=40&md5=fbbef83aaf8db705ac6a555f56a0b8f0,"College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China; School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China","Chen, Y., College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China; Meng, L., College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China; Zhou, H., College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, 410073, China; Xue, G., School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China",,5G mobile communication systems; Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Internet of things; Patient treatment; Privacy by design; Remote patient monitoring; Attribute based access control; Medical institutions; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Scalability and performance; Searchable encryptions; Single point failure; Trusted third parties; Data Sharing,,,,,"Steinberg, M.J., Rubin, E.R., (2009) The HIPAA Privacy Rule: Lacks Patient Benefit, Impedes Research Growth, , Association of Academic Health Centers; Samarati, P., Sweeney, L., (1998) Protecting Privacy When Disclosing Information: K-Anonymity and Its Enforcement through Generalization and Suppression, , Electronic Privacy Information Center; Dwork, C., Differential privacy: A survey of results (2008) Theory and Applications of Models of Computation.

In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay.",IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,9,1,,271,281,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112670673&doi=10.1109%2fTNSE.2021.3101842&partnerID=40&md5=c6f3eb1189145441e1c3032d92787dec,"College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China; Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, China; Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan","Tan, L., College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China; Yu, K., Global Information and Telecommunication Institute, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan; Shi, N., College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China; Yang, C., College of Computer Science, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China; Wei, W., School of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'An University of Technology, Xi'an, China; Lu, H., Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan",Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocation,Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing,,,,,"Dai, H.-N., Imran, M., Haider, N., Blockchain-enabled Internet of Medical Things to combat COVID-19 (2020) IEEE Internet Things Mag., 3 (3), pp. 52-57. , Sep; Yu, K., Tan, L., Shang, X., Huang, J., Srivastava, G., Chatterjee, P., Efficient and privacy-preserving medical research support platform against COVID-19: A blockchain-based approach (2021) IEEE Consum.

"Chen C., Yang J., Tsaur W.-J., Weng W., Wu C., Wei X.",Enterprise Data Sharing with Privacy-Preserved Based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain in IIOT’s Application,10.3390/s22031146,2022,Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ,Data Encryption and Hyperledger Fabric Channels,Hyperledger Fabric ,N/A,8,"Internet of Things (IoT) technology is now widely used in energy, healthcare, services, transportation, and other fields. With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT. In addition, our scheme outperforms the blockchain systems mainly used today in terms of both throughput, latency, and system overhead. The average throughput of our solution can reach 110 tps (transactions are executed per second), and the minimum throughput in experimental tests can reach 101 tps.",Sensors,22,3,1146,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123872454&doi=10.3390%2fs22031146&partnerID=40&md5=5b35034e37f378407bb45e95ab532dde,"School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China; School of Information Engineering, Changchun Sci-Tech University, Changchun, 130600, China; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, 41349, Taiwan; Computer Center, National Taipei University, New Taipei City, 237303, Taiwan; School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China","Chen, C., School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China, School of Information Engineering, Changchun Sci-Tech University, Changchun, 130600, China, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, 41349, Taiwan; Yang, J., School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China; Tsaur, W.-J., Computer Center, National Taipei University, New Taipei City, 237303, Taiwan; Weng, W., School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China; Wu, C., School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China; Wei, X., School of Computer and Information Engineering, Xiamen University of Technology, Xiamen, 361024, China",Chaincode; Data security sharing; Hyperledger Fabric blockchain; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); IPFS; Privacy-preserved,Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Block-chain; Chain codes; Data security sharing; Data Sharing; Filesystem; Hyperledg fabric blockchain; Industrial internet of thing; Inter-planetary file system; Privacy-preserved; Systems networks; Blockchain; article; blockchain; cloud computing; data integrity; encryption; experimental test; information security; internet of things; privacy; theft; velocity,,,,,"Qi, S., Lu, Y., Zheng, Y., Li, Y., Chen, X., Cpds: Enabling Compressed and Private Data Sharing for Industrial Internet of Things Over Blockchain (2021) IEEE Trans.

Data stored in each of the healthcare institution remain in silos which cannot be easily shared with other institutions due to technical and infrastructural constraints. Hospitals do not have an effective and secure data sharing mechanism leading to monetary and resource loss in the case of a person visiting different hospitals. Blockchain, a disruptive technology with secure and reliable decentralized framework, and can be used to circumvent problems in traditional healthcare architecture for secure storage, sharing and retrieval of Electronic Health Records (EHR). A blockchain-based framework integrated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for EHR in healthcare management has been proposed in this paper. This proposed framework will enable healthcare institutions to maintain fail-safe and tamper-proof healthcare ledgers in a decentralized manner. Hospitals and doctors act as lightweight nodes, whereas patient nodes can be full or lightweight nodes. The model proposes two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication for preventing fake node attacks. Patient-centric access model allows the patients to act as digital stewards for their health data, allowing access to doctors and hospitals on demand and revoking it after stipulated time. Symmetric key encryption (AES-128) is used for encrypting data before storing into IPFS. Asymmetric encryption (RSA-4096) is used for generating digital envelopes to pass on symmetric key to authorized entities. Digital signatures (RSA-1024) make sure that the transactions are valid and from authorized nodes. Hashing of the encrypted data is done using SHA-256 algorithm. Multiple layers of security implemented in this model makes sure that adversaries cannot obtain data stored in IPFS; even if they retrieve the data, it will not be meaningful since it is encrypted. The proposed framework for off-chain storage of health data using IPFS saves blockchain structure from scalability issues. Further the proposal for blockchain integration with IPFS helps preserve privacy in the healthcare system, making it highly secure, scalable and robust.",Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,164,,,152,167,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126923855&doi=10.1016%2fj.jpdc.2022.03.009&partnerID=40&md5=95c298aee0607c4977519e81f3707cdb,,"Jayabalan, J.; Jeyanthi, N.",Blockchain data security; Decentralized healthcare data; Electronic health records; Healthcare data security,Authentication; Client server computer systems; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Network security; Records management; Block-chain; Blockchain data security; Data security and privacy; Decentralised; Decentralized healthcare data; Filesystem; Health data; Healthcare data security; Healthcare institutions; Healthcare systems; Blockchain,,,,,"(2018), https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f, Addaquay, A beginner's guide to ipfs, [Online; accessed 26-May-2020]; Abunadi, I., Kumar, R.L., Bsf-ehr: blockchain security framework for electronic health records of patients (2021) Sensors, 21 (8), p. 2865; Ayub, M.F., Shamshad, S., Mahmood, K., Islam, S.H., Parizi, R.M., Choo, K.K.R., A provably secure two-factor authentication scheme for usb storage devices (2020) IEEE Trans.

"Ghayvat H., Pandya S., Bhattacharya P., Zuhair M., Rashid M., Hakak S., Dev K.",CP-BDHCA: Blockchain-Based Confidentiality-Privacy Preserving Big Data Scheme for Healthcare Clouds and Applications,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3097237,2022,Healthcare,Elliptic Curve Cryptographic and Two-step Authentication,N/A,N/A,30,"Healthcare big data (HBD) allows medical stakeholders to analyze, access, retrieve personal and electronic health records (EHR) of patients. Mostly, the records are stored on healthcare cloud and application (HCA) servers, and thus, are subjected to end-user latency, extensive computations, single-point failures, and security and privacy risks. A joint solution is required to address the issues of responsive analytics, coupled with high data ingestion in HBD and secure EHR access. Motivated from the research gaps, the paper proposes a scheme, that integrates blockchain (BC)-based confidentiality-privacy (CP) preserving scheme, CP-BDHCA, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC)-based digital signature framework, HCA-ECC is proposed to establish a session key for secure communication among different healthcare entities. Then, in the second phase, a two-step authentication framework is proposed that integrates Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES), named as HCA-RSAE that safeguards the ecosystem against possible attack vectors. CP-BDAHCA is compared against existing HCA cloud applications in terms of parameters like response time, average delay, transaction and signing costs, signing and verifying of mined blocks, and resistance to DoS and DDoS attacks. We consider 10 BC nodes and create a real-world customized dataset to be used with SEER dataset. The dataset has 30,000 patient profiles, with 1000 clinical accounts. Based on the combined dataset the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes like AI4SAFE, TEE, Secret, and IIoTEED, with a lower response time. For example, the scheme has a very less response time of 300 ms in DDoS. The average signing cost of mined BC transactions is 3,34 seconds, and for 205 transactions, has a signing delay of 1405 ms, with improved accuracy of ≈ 12% than conventional state-of-the-art approaches.

"Li T., Wang H., He D., Yu J.",Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving and Rewarding Private Data Sharing for IoT,10.1109/JIOT.2022.3147925,2022,Internet of Things (IoT),Ring Signatures and Monero,Hyperledger Fabric ,N/A,13,"The Internet of Things (IoT) devices possessed by individuals produce massive amounts of data. The private data onto specific IoT devices can be combined with intelligent platform to provide help for future research and prediction. As an important digital asset, individuals can sell private data to get rewards. Problems, such as privacy, security, and access control prevent individuals from sharing their private data. The blockchain technology is widely used to build an anonymous trading system. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure. Performance analysis and experimental results show that BPRPDS is efficient and practical.",IEEE Internet of Things Journal,9,16,,15138,15149,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124206453&doi=10.1109%2fJIOT.2022.3147925&partnerID=40&md5=ece29ab7d6f8a6ff7c02355dbb9297e8,"Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, School of Computer Science, Nanjing, 210003, China; Shaoxing University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shaoxing, 312000, China; Wuhan University, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan, 430072, China; Qingdao University, College of Computer Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266071, China","Li, T., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, School of Computer Science, Nanjing, 210003, China; Wang, H., Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security and Intelligent Processing, School of Computer Science, Nanjing, 210003, China, Shaoxing University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shaoxing, 312000, China; He, D., Wuhan University, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan, 430072, China; Yu, J., Qingdao University, College of Computer Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266071, China",Anonymity; blockchain; data sharing; ring signature,Authentication; Blockchain; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; User profile; Anonymity; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Privacy preserving; Private data sharing; Ring signature.; Ring signatures; Security; Sharing schemes; Smart contract,,,,,"Errapotu, S.M., Wang, J., Gong, Y., Cho, J.-H., Pan, M., Safe: Secure appliance scheduling for flexible and efficient energy consumption for smart home IoT (2018) IEEE Internet Things J., 5 (6), pp. 4380-4391. , Dec; Sodhro, A.H., Pirbhulal, S., Sangaiah, A.K., Convergence of IoT and product lifecycle management in medical health care (2018) Future Gener.
