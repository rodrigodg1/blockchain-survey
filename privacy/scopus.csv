In vehicular crowdsensing, organizations can have a right to access vehicles’ profiles with unlimited privilege, which results in security and privacy disclosure. Thus, based on the proposed blockchain, we design a secure and privacy-preserving vehicle’s profile record accessing (BSPPA) protocol. The proposed BSPPA is able to store the vehicle’s sensing data and indexes as encrypted data for a secure indexes search. This will result in controlling the privilege of data access and prevent vehicle’s data from being revealing private data. Analysis of the security is demonstrated to show the efficiency of the BSPPA scheme. Furthermore, the performance evaluation shows the efficiency of the BSPPA protocol. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Security and privacy-preserving; Sensing data; Smart vehicle; Vehicular crowdsensing","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135933758"

The exposure of user privacy has motivated further research on privacy-enhancing data sharing schemes, which poses additional difficulties for regulation. In this paper, we propose RPChain, a framework that allows users to share data anonymously and cuts the link between data sender and data receiver via ring signature and broadcast. Combining secret sharing and proxy re-encryption, RPChain allows identity privacy and transaction privacy to be revealed only if a data transfer is determined to be illegal by a vote. We utilize a thresholding mechanism to spread the computational overhead across different authorities and adopt data indexing for efficiency. Experiments show that RPChain can handle large throughput and data size. Security analysis shows the promise of RPChain in ensuring identity and transaction privacy.

Now, the mHealth faces serious challenges such as data leakage and unauthorised access currently. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) which has been employed for mHealth is an excellent cryptographic primitive of securing data sharing. However, there are still some security and efficiency issues in the ABE-based data sharing scheme for mHealth. Firstly, the explicit storage of access policy may expose the privacy of users. Secondly, the computation cost is high, especially in the mHealth with IoT devices. Thirdly, the authentication of access rights to shared data is usually performed by the centralised third parties or IoT devices with limited resources. To handle the above issues, this paper presents a privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing scheme. The scheme partially hides access policy to protect user's privacy, and introduces an offline mechanism in key generation and encryption phase to improve efficiency of mHealth. Furthermore, it also provides decentralised and trusted authentication of data access right based on blockchain. The security proofs and the experiment results demonstrate that the presented scheme has better security and efficiency. © 2023 The Author(s).

According to the storage requirements, the aim of this study was to develop store and access mechanisms for achieving data privacy, decentralisation, and load balancing in a data storage system. We explore how factors such as data privacy, file segmentation, security processes, and auditing mechanisms affect the performance of ubiquitous storage systems. We developed a trust evaluation model to reduce the access error rates, which are caused by the abnormal storage hosts or transmission failed. The file segmentation and encryption methods are used to store data in untrustworthy decentralised hosts. Although such data can be decrypted, they are difficult to recognise because a part of the transformed file is adopted to protect user privacy. Furthermore, with the developed mechanism, any user can share their storage and computing power to achieve blockchain-based peer-to-peer storage functions. We conducted a series of simulations to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed data privacy mechanism and existing data privacy mechanisms in ubiquitous storage. The results indicated that the proposed mechanism outperformed other mechanisms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Data privacy; File segment; Sharing storage; System performance; Ubiquitous","Cloud storage; Computing power; Cryptography; Data privacy; Electric power transmission; Peer to peer networks; Block-chain; File segment; File segmentations; Mechanism development; Performance; Performances evaluation; Privacy mechanisms; Sharing storage; Systems performance; Ubiquitous; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160859441"

Before being stored in the data center, sensitive data and non-sensitive data should adopt different data processing methods in the process of sensor data fusion. In the high security analysis scenario of Industrial Internet of Things, only the verifier with a specified high security level can verify the resulting aggregate signature. So far, no one has explored how to ensure sensitive data privacy in the designated-verifier aggregate signatures. Motivated by it, this paper proposes a designated-verifier aggregate signature scheme (named DVAS) based on permissioned blockchain to achieve sensitive data privacy. In this scheme, the aggregator can be used not only to aggregate signatures, but also to sanitize data. Through smart contracts, the aggregator can sanitize the sensitive data according to the contract, and convert the original signature of the sensitive data into a valid signature. Therefore, DVAS can achieve elastic sensitive data privacy, not limited to encryption operations. The security attributes of DVAS include conditional anonymity, unforgeability, immutability and protecting data privacy. At the same time, DVAS realizes accountability through signature verification. Finally, the formal security proof, performance evaluation and experiments indicate that DVAS is secure, effective and practical for Industrial Internet of Things.  © 2023 IEEE.","Aggregate signature; designated-verifier; Industrial Internet of Things; permissioned blockchain; sensitive data privacy","Aggregates; Authentication; Blockchain; Internet of things; Network security; Sensitive data; Sensor nodes; Aggregate signature; Block-chain; Designated verifiers; Industrial internet of thing; Permissioned blockchain; Security; Sensitive data privacy; Sensitive datas; Cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165317072"

We prove that the anonymous credential in our protocol achieves the ideal functionality. For the secure access control and privacy protection of the data accessors, we propose an efficiently anonymous authentication scheme which utilizes the ElGamal commitment and the one-out-of-many proof to ensure a data accessor is authorized, but any unauthorized entities cannot learn the real identity of the data accessor, and even the data owner does not know who (although in the access control list) and when downloads his/her data. The blockchain platform is used to record the data storing, access control list, and the storage addresses, which helps to enhance the security level of the protocol.

Additionally, edge technology is trending rapidly which brings the computing and data storing facility closer to the user end (device), in order to overcome network bottlenecks. This study, therefore, utilises the transparency, security, efficiency of blockchain technology along with the computing and storing facility at the edge level to establish privacy preserved storing and tracking schemes for electronic health records (EHRs). Since the EHR stored in a block is accessible by the peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes, privacy has always been a matter of great concern for any blockchain-based activities. Therefore, to address this privacy issue, multilevel blockchain, which can enforce and preserve complete privacy and security of any blockchain-based application or environment, has become one of the recent blockchain research trends. In this article, we propose an EHR sharing architecture consisting of three different interrelated multilevel or hierarchical chains confined within three different network layers using edge computing. Furthermore, since EHRs are sensitive, a specific data de-identification or anonymisation strategy is also applied to further strengthen the privacy and security of the data shared. © 2022 by the author(s).","Blockchain; De-identification; Edge Computing; Health Level Seven (HL7); Medical Data; Privacy; Security","Distributed ledger; Edge computing; Network architecture; Network layers; Sensitive data; Block-chain; De-identification; Edge computing; Electronic health; Health level seven (HL7); Health records; Medical data; Privacy; Privacy and security; Security; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139519593"

The user identity privacy is improved here by hiding the relationship between the input address and the actual output address. Many existing mechanisms like basic-stealth address, double-key stealth address (DKSAP), improved stealth address and perfected double-key stealth address were proposed earlier. But the commonly used double-key stealth address protocol (DKSAP) mandates that the sender delivers the temporary public key along with the transaction, making it possible for attackers to discriminate between stealth and non-stealth transactions and causing a privacy leakage risk. While in the perfected double-key, stealth address protocol, senders and receivers keep track of the number of transactions they have with other users in local transaction record databases. To prevent the temporary key for a transaction from being leaked, senders and receivers generate a temporary key pair based on the number of transactions that have happened between them. We propose a randomized addressing model, where the sender creates a one-time address for every transaction based on their last transaction id and the public key of the receiver which restricts the attacker to track the user identity and transaction information. To improve the real estate technology via the blockchain, the proposed model is deployed in a blockchain-based commercial real estate platform. Finally, we verify the proposed protocol by comparing it with the existing techniques in terms of different performance metrics. Based on the security analysis results obtained, the proposed methodology tends to be efficient in terms of privacy protection, receiver anonymity, copyright protection, and anti-tampering. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Elliptic curve cryptography; Information security; Privacy protection; Stealth address protocol","Copyrights; Data transfer; Privacy-preserving techniques; Public key cryptography; Block-chain; Curve cryptography; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Public keys; Real-estates; Stealth address protocol; User identity; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142395763"

The widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be viewed in several applications like smart cars, smart cities, e-commerce, and cyber-physical systems. The huge amount of data produced and transmitted by these systems is handled by cloud-based storage services, which are vulnerable to multiple threats risking the privacy and security features of the application. Cloud storage services employ encryption algorithms to ensure data confidentiality, but it fails to address the privacy issues. Apart from the privacy risks, in these systems, the identity of a user who shares and accesses the data is traceable, as it is required to verify user eligibility before providing access. Also, a vast amount of daily data is stored on a centralized system that processes service requests from multiple users, posing considerable risks to the system's stability during peak periods. To address these challenges faced during the data sharing process in a centralized system, Service Oriented Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing (SOPPDS) platform based on a blockchain framework is proposed. The modified Key Policy-Attribute-based Encryption (MKP-ABE) technique is applied to securely share the data between the service owners and the service consumers. It was evident from the performance evaluation of the proposed SOPPDS platform that the encryption process takes lesser time than the decryption process. Also, the cryptographic operations performed on the prime order sets exhibited increased latency and computational cost. It was observed that comparatively, cryptographic operations performed on composite order sets could overcome the issues in prime order sets. SOPPDS platform works well in preserving the users' privacy, ensuring anonymity in the data sharing process, and maintaining the confidentiality of the data shared in the system. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

It has been assisted by a lot of interest in a decentralized and distributed public ledger system integrated as a peer-to-peer network. A tamper-proof digital framework is created for sharing and storing data, where the linked block structure is utilized to verify and store the data. A trusted consensus method has been adopted to synchronize the changes in the original data. However, it is challenging for Ethereum to maintain security at all blockchain levels. As such, “public–private key cryptography” can be utilized to provide privacy over Ethereum networks. Several privacy issues make it difficult to use blockchain approaches over various applications. Another issue is that the existing blockchain systems operate poorly over large-scale data. Owing to these issues, a novel blockchain framework in the Ethereum network with soft computing is proposed. The major intent of the proposed technology is to preserve the data for transmission purposes. This new model is enhanced with the help of a new hybrid algorithm: Adaptive Border Collie Rain Optimization Algorithm (ABC-ROA). This hybrid algorithm generates the optimal key for data restoration and sanitization. Optimal key generation is followed by deriving the multi objective constraints. Here, some of the noteworthy objectives, such as information preservation (IP) rate, degree of modification (DM), false rule (FR) generation, and hiding failure (HF) rate are considered. Finally, the proposed method is successfully implemented, and its results are validated through various measures. The recommended module ensures a higher security level for data sharing. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive border collie rain optimization; data privacy preservation system; data sanitization and restoration; Ethereum blockchain technology; supply chain network","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151715676"

In this paper, we propose two schemes, keyword-based re-encryption (KRE) scheme and oblivious transfer-based re-encryption (OTRE) scheme with hybrid blockchain secure health data sharing. KRE preserves data privacy of patient and provides keyword-based access with reduced key management overhead. OTRE is a superset of KRE that employs OT to preserve privacy of users’ data and multiple data sharing. The schemes are collusion-resistant against an honest but curious cloud and malicious users. Hybrid blockchain obviates the need for a single trusted authority and allows large-scale secure data sharing. Blockchain also enables end-user authentication and verifiability of data on the cloud through smart contracts. The privacy provisioning step was responsible for the increased time in the OTRE scheme. We present a concrete construction for KRE and OTRE that satisfies indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attacks with a random oracle model and formally proves its security.

A fundamental worry in the establishment of large private networks is mitigating the danger of transactional data privacy breaches caused by adversaries using a variety of exploitation techniques. This study presents a privacy-preserving architecture for ensuring the privacy and security of transaction data in large private networks. The proposed model employs digital certificates, RSA-based public key infrastructure, and the blockchain to address user transactional data privacy concerns. The model also guarantees that data in transit remains secure and unaltered and that its provenance remains authentic and secure during node-to-node interactions within a large private network. The proposed model has increased the encryption speed by about 17 times, while the decryption process is expedited by 4 times. Therefore, the average overall acceleration obtained was 16.5. Both the findings of the security analysis and the performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed model can safeguard transactional data during communications on large private networks more effectively and securely than the existing solutions. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.","","acceleration; article; blockchain; data privacy; encryption; privacy; velocity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173675625"

Its fusion processing enables the further mining of data and utilization of data value and broadens the path for the sharing and dissemination of media data. However, it also faces serious problems in terms of protecting user and data privacy. Many privacy protection methods have been proposed to solve the problem of privacy leakage during the process of data sharing, but they suffer from two flaws: 1) the lack of algorithmic frameworks for specific scenarios such as dynamic datasets in the media domain; 2) the inability to solve the problem of the high computational complexity of ciphertext in multi-source data privacy protection, resulting in long encryption and decryption times. In this paper, we propose a multi-source data privacy protection method based on homomorphic encryption and blockchain technology, which solves the privacy protection problem of multi-source heterogeneous data in the dissemination of media and reduces ciphertext processing time. We deployed the proposed method on the Hyperledger platform for testing and compared it with the privacy protection schemes based on k-anonymity and differential privacy. The experimental results show that the key generation, encryption, and decryption times of the proposed method are lower than those in data privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity technology and differential privacy technology. This significantly reduces the processing time of multi-source data, which gives it potential for use in many applications. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, blockchain technology faces the problem of data availability attacks during its application, which greatly limits the scope and domain of blockchain applications. One of the most advantageous researches to address this problem is the scalable data availability solution that integrates coding theory design into the Merkle tree promise. Based on this scheme, this paper combines a zero-knowledge accumulator with higher efficiency and security with local repair coding, and proposes a data availability scheme with strong dataset privacy protection. The scheme first encodes the data block information on the blockchain to ensure tamper-proof data, and then uses a zero-knowledge accumulator to store the encoded data block information. Its main purpose is to use zero-knowledge property to protect the accumulation set information stored in the accumulator from being leaked and to ensure that no other information about the accumulation set is revealed during the data transmission. It fundamentally reduces the possibility of attackers generating fraudulent information by imitating block data and further resists data availability attacks. © 2023 by the authors.","blockchain; data availability; privacy protection; zero knowledge accumulator","Computer programming; Data privacy; Trees (mathematics); Block-chain; Data availability; Data blocks; Data privacy protections; Decentralisation; Privacy protection; Research and application; Set offs; Zero knowledge; Zero knowledge accumulator; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148691722"

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25% and encryption elapsed time by 48%. Furthermore, the proposed CP-ABE access control method is adaptive to storing and sharing a massive amount of data. With the increase in the number of access control policies, the overall time-consuming of the scheme does not increase, and the time-consuming of decryption can also be stabilized at about 2 s.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE); Consortium blockchain; homomorphic encryption; InterPlanetary File System (IPFS); privacy protection; secure sharing","Access control; Cloud storage; Data mining; Distributed ledger; File organization; Privacy-preserving techniques; Trusted computing; Block-chain; Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Cloud-computing; Consortium blockchain; Filesystem; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Interplanetary file system; Privacy protection; Secure sharing; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135765727"

Although substantial progress has been made in designing compliance schemes in recent years, current approaches suffer from various limitations, including compliance incompleteness, regulation faultiness, and privacy leak. This paper introduces, an IoT data privacy regulation compliance scheme that leverages TEE and blockchain technology. In the protocol, efficiently handles both dynamic and static consent of data owners and utilizes TEE for compliance analysis of requests and processes. By storing encrypted critical data, the blockchain facilitates privacy-preserving audits of the entire compliance process.

At the same time, malicious users could generate and share false data, which would be potentially harmful for stakeholders relying on this data for their safety and mobility decisions.

Real-time data validation is challenging, considering constant mobility alongside the reduction of resource consumption at the devices and, therefore, to address this, we employ an adaptive approach to the problem where the validation frequency as well as storage on the blockchain are dynamically decided by the nodes, based on the network conditions.

However, when the system collects the corresponding power data, several severe security and privacy issues are encountered. The identity and private injection data may be maliciously intercepted by network attackers and be tampered with to damage the services of ITS and smart grids. Existing approaches requiring high computational overhead render them unsuitable for the resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environment. To address above problems, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme for fog-based ITS. First, a fog computing and blockchain co-aware aggregation framework of power injection data is designed, which provides strong support for ITS to achieve secure and efficient power injection. Second, Paillier homomorphic encryption, the batch aggregation signature mechanism and a Bloom filter are effectively integrated with efficient aggregation of power injection data with security and privacy guarantees. In addition, the fine-grained homomorphic aggregation is designed for power injection data generated by all EVs, which provides solid data support for accurate power dispatching and supply management in ITS. Experiments show that the total computational cost is significantly reduced in the proposed scheme while providing security and privacy guarantees. The proposed scheme is more suitable for ITS with latency-sensitive applications and is also adapted to deploying devices with limited resources. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

However, it also introduces a number of security and privacy issues not foreseen before. These are very serious issues from consumer's perspective who do not want any malicious entity to infer any personal information from the consumption data. Data aggregation plays a significant role in protecting user's consumption data. SGs deploy a single entity, called an aggregator, to collect and aggregate end users’ encrypted consumption data. While a number of secure data aggregation schemes have been proposed, many existing schemes suffer from a single point of failure in the aggregation process. Recently, some blockchain-based data aggregation schemes have been proposed to overcome this problem. While overcoming the failure issues, these schemes do not provide the necessary security and privacy requirements of smart grids. Furthermore, these schemes suffer from high computation and communication cost due to the use of RSA-based signatures.

Big data pricing is challenging due to uncertainty about its value. Auctions are effective strategies for allocating goods to the bidder with the highest valuation and a mechanism for protecting the interests of both data sellers and market participants. However, most existing data auctions are centralized, making it difficult to establish trust and transparency among sellers, buyers, and auctioneers. Moreover, online environments suffer from the lack of transparency and verifiability, which can lead to collusion attacks in data auctions. To address these challenges, we leverage blockchain technology and propose an anti-collusion smart contract-based data auction system. Since blockchain data transparency often compromises privacy, we leverage cryptographic techniques to enhance privacy, integrity, fairness, correctness, and non-repudiation. To ensure that all participants benefit from the auction, an auction model that considers rationality and budget balance is developed.

This paper proposes a data management framework of medical network community based on Consortium Blockchain (CB) and Federated learning (FL), which realizes the data security sharing between medical institutions and research institutions. Under this framework, the data security sharing mechanism of medical network community based on smart contract and the data privacy protection mechanism based on FL and alliance chain are designed to ensure the security of data and the privacy of important data in medical network community, respectively. An intelligent contract system based on Keyed-Homomorphic Public Key (KH-PKE) Encryption scheme is designed, so that medical data can be saved in the CB in the form of ciphertext, and the automatic sharing of data is realized. Zero knowledge mechanism is used to ensure the correctness of shared data. Moreover, the zero-knowledge mechanism introduces the dynamic group signature mechanism of chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) anonymity, which makes the scheme more efficient in computing and communication cost.

As a significant carrier of medical data, electronic medical record (EMR) is convenient to be stored and retrieved, which greatly simplifies the experience of medical treatment and cuts down the trivial work of paramedics. However, EMRs usually include much sensitive information such as patients&#x2019; identification numbers or home addresses that may be easily captured by unauthorized doctors and cloud servers. Based on this concern, e-healthcare systems can make use of attribute-based encryption (ABE) to protect private information while achieving fine-grained access control of encrypted EMRs. Whereas, most ABE schemes do not support both policy hiding and keyword search. To address the above issues, we propose an inner product searchable encryption scheme with multi-keyword search (MK-IPSE) based on blockchain to provide full privacy preservation and efficient ciphertext retrieval for EMRs. Inner product encryption (IPE) can not only specify access permissions such that only users with matched attributes can get the target files, but also support access policy hiding. Besides, the proposed scheme combines searchable encryption (SE) and federated blockchain (FB) to implement efficient and stable multi-keyword search. Compared with the existing schemes, MK-IPSE shows better performance on computation and storage. Additionally, security analysis demonstrates that our scheme can resist IND-CKA and collusion attacks.

Patients’ medical data poses an ethical and legal quandary for healthcare organisations, making security a difficult problem to solve. Early studies suggest that blockchain technology could be a substantial answer to the IoT’s data security issues. It is therefore critical to ensure data security when designing a blockchain approach for healthcare applications. A blockchain-based data broadcast strategy with a categorization model in the healthcare industry is proposed in this study. Data from multiple IoT data providers, like blockchain, is used to make secure training algorithms. To ensure a safe and secure learning environment, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) technology is used. The oppositional-based harmony search (OHS) algorithm was used to make the best key for the HE algorithm. For the group of multiple shares of acquired images, a multiple-share creation (MSC) ideal is used. This gives privacy and security to the model. In addition, the blockchain technology is used to transmit data securely to the cloud server, which performs the classification model based on the convolutional neural network to determine the presence of disease. To summarise, the proposed model is known as the OHE-MSC based network, and it employs blockchain technology to create a secure and trustworthy platform for the exchange of data between many data providers using IoT and logging it in a shared ledger. Two benchmark datasets, such as the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (BCWD) and the Heart Disease Data Set (HDD), are used to evaluate the projected method's performance. Several parts of the simulation showed that the OHE-MSC-based network model achieved better performance than all other approaches. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Blockchain model; Heart disease data set; Homomorphic encryption; Multiple share creation; Oppositional based harmony search; Security","Benchmarking; Computer aided instruction; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Distributed ledger; Internet of things; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Blockchain model; Data set; Harmony search; Heart disease; Heart disease data set; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Multiple share creation; Oppositional based harmony search; Security; Blockchain","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160855239"

Similarly, patients often require access to their data. However, ensuring that sensitive health data is shared securely while prioritizing privacy is essential. This paper proposes an innovative solution called the quaternion based neural network, Advanced Data Security Architecture in Healthcare Environment (ADSAH), which combines Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) with a blockchain mechanism and a Deep Fuzzy Based Neural Network (DFBNN) to safeguard cloud-stored health data. The proposed approach begins by encoding the input medical data using an encoder and then encrypting the encoded data using ECC techniques. The secret key for encrypting the data is securely stored within a blockchain framework. The key is divided into blocks to enhance security, and the SHA algorithm is employed to identify key events within these blocks. These key events are subsequently stored in a cloud storage system. A modified genetic algorithm is utilized to generate the encryption and decryption key. This algorithm is explicitly tailored to secure healthcare data. Authorized patients or physicians can access medical data using the secret key to decrypt and retrieve the necessary information. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated by considering factors such as time and cost and is compared against existing studies. The evaluation demonstrates notable improvements, including a reduction in the time required for the encryption and decryption process, as well as a decrease in transaction and execution costs when compared to previous research. By incorporating ECC with a blockchain mechanism and DNN, the ADSAH approach offers an advanced solution for ensuring the security and privacy of cloud-stored health data. It provides robust encryption and facilitates efficient and cost-effective access to authorized individuals while safeguarding sensitive health information. © 2023, Indian Academy of Sciences.","blockchain mechanism; deep neural network; elliptic curve cryptography; Healthcare data; improved quaternion based neural network; security","Blockchain; Cloud storage; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Genetic algorithms; Geometry; Health care; Network security; Sensitive data; Block-chain; Blockchain mechanism; Curve cryptography; Elliptic curve; Elliptic curve cryptography; Health data; Healthcare data; Improved quaternion based neural network; Neural-networks; Security; Deep neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171986494"

We introduce a decentralized data governance framework based on blockchain technology, proxy re-encryption, and Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (BBS) signatures to let data owners control, selectively share and track their data through privacy-enhancing, consent management, and selective disclosure mechanisms. Besides, our framework allows the data consumers to understand data lineage through a blockchain-based provenance mechanism.

The emergence of blockchain and federated learning brings new directions. In this paper, a data-sharing model that combines blockchain and federated learning is proposed to solve the security and privacy problems of data sharing in IoV. First, we use federated learning to share data instead of exposing actual data and propose an adaptive differential privacy scheme to further balance the privacy and availability of data. Then, we integrate the verification scheme into the consensus process, so that the consensus computation can filter out low-quality models. Experimental data shows that our data-sharing model can better balance the relationship between data availability and privacy, and also has enhanced security.  © 2013 China Institute of Communications.","blockchain; data sharing; federated learning; Internet of Vehicles; privacy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152794182"

To address the above issues, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving data sharing scheme with security-enhanced access control. In the scheme, a secure data sharing architecture using dual-blockchain and the interplanetary file system (IPFS) is presented to provide decentralized and scalable storage. Based on the architecture, a blockchain-assisted multi-authority attribute-based encryption (BA-MA-ABE) algorithm with efficient attribute revocation and computation is designed in our work. Our BA-MA-ABE lever-ages blockchain to securely manage partial decryption keys and provides fine-grained access control over encrypted data. We also devise smart contracts that can support traceable access control over the flow of data while protecting user identity privacy with verifiable attribute credentials. In comparison with some existing work, our scheme shows more comprehensive security features with lower user computation overhead.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Access control; Computational efficiency; Data Sharing; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Attribute-based encryptions; Block-chain; Data driven; Data Sharing; Data-sharing platforms; Decentralised; Multi authorities; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Sharing schemes; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164736147"

These methods may not be applicable for global blockchains, or they may be invalid for transactions. Since most of the transactions in blockchains occur via scalable local ledgers that compromises on peer validation of transaction at local/ global level. Hence, it is required to have an interface mechanism that enables the security of data. In this chapter, blockchain is regarded as a potential solution to secure the data via IoT supply chains, and a ML algorithm is utilised data. The ML model processes the data management based on the number of transactions, time of transaction, and transaction confirmation time. The ML algorithm is designed with a consensus protocol, which improves the scalability of data via blockchain networks. It helps in integrating the IoT data transmission while assessing the parameters.

However, increasing ITS devices impose grand challenges in privacy-preserving and efficient data sharing. Recent research has demonstrated that integrating searchable symmetric encryption in blockchain enables privacy-preserving data sharing among ITS devices. However, existing solutions focus only on single-keyword searches over encrypted ITS data on the blockchain and suffer from privacy and efficiency issues when extended to multi-keyword scenarios. This work proposes a bloom filter-based multi-keyword search protocol for ITS data with enhanced efficiency and privacy preservation. We design a bloom filter to select a low-frequency keyword from the multiple keywords input by the ITS data owner. The low-frequency keyword can filter out a large portion of the ITS data from the search result, thus significantly reducing the computational cost. Furthermore, each identifier-keyword pair is attached with a pseudorandom tag that enables the completion of a search operation in only one round. In this manner, privacy is preserved because there are no intermediate rounds and results. In addition to the multi-keyword search protocol, we specify the addition and deletion protocols to enable dynamic updates of data records.

Therefore, a blockchain-based flight operation data sharing scheme, named BFOD is designed to achieve the privacy protection and secure sharing of flight operation data. In BFOD, physical entities of airlines, airports and air traffic control are divided into data owners, data requesters and authorization institutes according to the business logic. First of all, the authorization institute grants a hash anonymous identity and different levels of access right for each civil aviation corporation. When the data are accessed, a hash anonymous identity is designed to verify the access right of the data requester, which protects identity privacy. Then, zero-knowledge succinct noninteractive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) is employed to verify whether the flight operation data meets the specific requirements raised by the data requester without disclosing data privacy. Finally, a proxy re-encryption is used to improve the sharing efficiency of flight operation data. In addition, a grouped practical byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT) algorithm is proposed to reduce consensus latency. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the consensus latency of the grouped PBFT algorithm reduces 91.4% under the number of consensus node N=100, and the BFOD meets data confidentiality, availability and privacy protection, which is feasible and efficient.

For effective diagnosis the medical practitioners need to access the healthcare data of the patient and similarly, the patient also needs to access the data. Sharing such a sensitive health data needs to be secured and privacy-preserving is ensured. Before uploading and downloading private health data, the data should be secured. To ensure security and privacy-preserving of health data stored in the cloud by implementing the improved Quaternion-based neural network with the blockchain mechanism. Improved Quaternion neural network cryptography is executed for encrypting the shared health data. Encrypted data’s secret key is stored by utilizing blockchain which is converted into blocks and the SHA algorithm is employed for identifying key events in the blocks which are stored in cloud storage. The modified genetic algorithm is used to generate a key which would be used for encryption and decryption. The authorized patient or physician can access the medical data by using the secret key to decrypt and download the medical data.

Blockchain is a data-distributed processing technology that tracks data records to support secure electronic money transactions and data security management in a peer-to-peer environment without the need of a central trusted authority. The data uploaded to the blockchain-shared ledger are immutable, making tracking integrity preservation facile. However, blockchain technology is limited because it is challenging to utilize in the industry owing to its inability to correct data, even when inaccurate data are uploaded. Accordingly, research on blockchain mechanisms that consider privacy-preserving data management is required to commercialize blockchain technology. Previously, off-chain, blacklist, and hard-fork methods have been proposed; however, their application is challenging or impractical. Therefore, to protect privacy, we propose a layered blockchain mechanism that can correct data by adding a buffer blockchain. We evaluated the latency, security, and space complexity of layered blockchains. The security and security-to-latency ratio for data management of the selective layered blockchain is 2.2 and 11.3 times higher than the conventional blockchains, respectively. The proposed selective layered blockchain is expected to promote the commercialization of blockchain technologies in various industries by protecting user privacy. © 2023 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

The publish and subscribe (Pub/Sub) paradigm, with its asynchronous, one-to-many and decoupling characteristics, is considered to be a promising communication model in IoT. However, designing a Pub/Sub framework for IoT data sharing confronts two challenges: Byzantine faults and privacy concerns. Byzantine nodes that are subjectively malicious or hacked by attackers may discard or forge data in the broker network composed of untrusted IoT organizations. Unauthorized brokers or clients may try to obtain the content of publications or subscriptions, thus violating the IoT data privacy. Existing works have limitations in terms of relatively low scalability and high overhead in tackling these two challenges. In this paper, we propose Galaxy, a blockchain based Pub/Sub IoT data sharing framework. To achieve Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) Pub/Sub, Galaxy adopts sharding to improve scalability and achieve efficient BFT Pub/Sub workflow within each shard with a novel leader rotation scheme. In attaining privacy-preserving Pub/Sub, a secret key sharing and encrypted Pub/Sub scheme is designed in Galaxy to achieve low overhead without breaking the decoupling of the system. We implemented a prototype of Galaxy and deployed it on Alibaba Cloud for experimental evaluation. The experiment results show the feasibility and efficiency of Galaxy.

Previous secure outsourcing solutions mostly assume that the server is honest-but-curious while the adversary model of a malicious server that may return incorrect results is rarely explored. Moreover, with the increasing popularity of verifiable computations, existing verification schemes are yet not efficient and cannot cater to different scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based verifiable search framework for the adversarial cloud outsourcing context. When outsourcing the encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS), we also store the encrypted data index in a decentralized blockchain (i.e., Ethereum in this paper) which is public and cannot be modified. Once a user is authorized, he/she can flexibly obtain the query results and efficiently check the query integrity via the pre-deployed smart contract, without the need of the data owner being online. Moreover, for user's privacy protection, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to deliver the access authorization without any identity disclosure.

Data owners set up groups, generating and uploading their data to cloud storage, while other users in the groups download and make use of it, which is called group data sharing. As all kinds of cloud service, data group sharing also suffers from hardware/software failures and human errors. Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes are proposed to check the integrity of data stored in cloud without downloading. However, there are still some unmet needs lying in auditing group shared data. Researchers propose four issues necessary for a secure group shared data auditing: public verification, identity privacy, collusion attack resistance and traceability. However, none of the published work has succeeded in achieving all of these properties so far. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based ring signature PDP scheme for group shared data, with an instance deployed on a cloud server. We design a linkable ring signature method called Linkable Homomorphic Authenticable Ring Signature (LHARS) to implement public anonymous auditing for group data.

As an essential prerequisite for mining potential value from these data, data sharing is crucial and getting more and more attention. However, security and privacy concerns, and the lack of effective incentive mechanisms in the decentralized environment hinder the data owners from sharing their data. In this paper, we propose a federated learning and blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing system, which solve the privacy leakage problem of federated learning and the scalability problem of blockchain by their technical complementarity. Considering the resource shortage and the heterogeneity of terminals, we first design a cross-layer architecture by exploiting the cloud-edge-terminal collaboration, and innovatively propose differential data sharing by dividing the providers into origin data providers and model providers. Then, we design a targeted incentive mechanism to maximize the utility of requesters and two types of data providers by formulating it into a two-stage Stackelberg game. Finally, a gradient-based algorithm is designed to get the optimal solution. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed data-sharing system could eliminate privacy concerns and motivate more participants to share data. With 500 nodes, DASC is 1.72 seconds faster than SMC and 2.59 seconds faster than SDC.

Data security is a significant problem since training and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier often involves compiling tagged IoT data from several organizations. Beyond causing the suppliers to lose money, disclosing sensitive information might cause significant problems. To solve these issues, introduced a secure SVM, which is a Privacy-Preserving SVM (PP-SVM) training method using block chain-based encoded IoT data, to fill the void between ideal assumptions and practical restrictions. IoT messages are encrypted before being stored on a decentralized system because Block chain offers safe and dependable data exchange platforms across several data sources. Using a homomorphic cryptographic algorithm, Paillier, reliable modules have been developed, such as protected algebraic multiplying and protected comparison. Furthermore, a protected SVM learning algorithm that only needs two conversations during a single step has been created. According to stringent security assessment, proposed approach guarantees SVM model parameters for data professionals and secrecy of sensitive information for each data source. Extensive testing backs up effectiveness of the suggested plan. © 2023","Block chain; Data security; Data sharing; Industrial IoT; Machine learning; Privacy; Support vector machine","Blockchain; Electronic data interchange; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Amount of information; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Data-source; Industrial IoT; IOT applications; Machine-learning; Privacy; Sensitive informations; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170435383"

It aims to provide users with more diverse and vivid web services as well as the complete control over their own data. To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy.

However, the current device binding requires direct identifiers and grants manufacturers ownership of the generated data, limiting user control and raising privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a blockchain-based platform with two distinct blockchains: decentralized identity and physiological data. Users register decentralized identities on the first blockchain, which are then used for device binding on the second blockchain, enabling de-identified data collection. The platform generates user-specific smart contracts on the Physiological Data blockchain and ensures complete user control over data access.

Yet, security breaches and privacy issues could affect medical data sent over open communication channels. Due to its distinctive qualities including immutability, blockchain technology, anonymity, decentralization, and, verifiability has drawn more notice in various fields. With a variety of multimedia techniques, healthcare organizations all over the globe are evolving into more user-centered, harmonized, and effective models. The management of enormous amounts of information, like records and photographs of all the individual improve the person's labor requirements and the security hazards. Recent advances in the healthcare industry have led to the creation of enormous numbers of electronic health records (EHRs). The owner of the data can manage the EHR data and share thanks with certain individuals in the EHR system. It is challenging for information to guarantee protection and detection procedures due to the enormous amount of information in the medical care models. Hence, in order to secure the EHR, the development of artificial intelligence techniques like blockchain and a new privacy preservation model is recommended for this work. Particularly, the Merkle tree is a key component of blockchain technology. In this proposed model, the Merkle tree is applied that helps for effective and safe authentication of huge data frameworks with the purpose of verifiability of the posted patient data. This model consists of two main phases, such as data sanitization and data restoration. Here, the sanitization operation is based on the creation of the optimal key using a new iteration-based firefly reptile search algorithm (IFRSA). The creation of the optimal key is established by functioning a multi-objective function which includes the factors like Euclidean distance, hiding ratio, and, data preservation ratio among encrypted data using the original key and the key with a variation. Finally, the electronic health care model becomes more private, dependable, and helpful through our suggested system. The comparison shows the supremacy of the developed approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Electronic medical records; Iteration-based firefly reptile search algorithm; Merkle tree-blockchain; Optimal key generation; Privacy preservation","Data privacy; Health care; Heuristic algorithms; Hospital data processing; Information management; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Medical computing; Optimization; Trees (mathematics); Block-chain; Electronic medical record; Iteration-based firefly reptile search algorithm; Key generation; Medical record; Merkle tree-blockchain; Merkle trees; Optimal key generation; Privacy preservation; Search Algorithms; Blockchain","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169843686"

People join in group and share data with each other, making team work more convenient. This new application scenario also faces data security threats, even more complex. When a user quit its group, remaining data block signatures must be re-signed to ensure security. Some researchers noticed this problem and proposed a few works to relieve computing overhead on user side. However, considering the privacy and security need of group auditing, there still lacks a comprehensive solution to implement secure group user revocation, supporting identity privacy preserving and collusion attack resistance. Aiming at this target, we construct a concrete scheme based on ring signature and smart contracts. We introduce linkable ring signature to build a kind of novel meta data for integrity proof enabling anonymous verification. And the new meta data supports secure revocation. Meanwhile, smart contracts are using for resisting possible collusion attack and malicious re-signing computation. Under the combined effectiveness of both signature method and blockchain smart contracts, our proposal supports reliable user revocation and signature re-signing, without revealing any user identity in the whole process.

In this paper, we consider the problem of privacy-preserving file retrieval. A new framework named PriFR is proposed by integrating the blockchain and cloud computing infrastructures. The large-scale original files are encrypted and outsourced to the public cloud server. The encrypted retrieval indexes are stored on the full nodes in the blockchain to support traceable and unforgeable retrieval services. This design embraces the benefits brought by both cloud computing and blockchain. For the first time, PriFR decomposes the file retrieval problem into the numerical query and keyword search on the file metadata. In doing so, each file can be characterized more precisely than the traditional keyword search based schemes. In addition to functionality, PriFR only applies fast and lightweight symmetric cryptographical primitives to reach near plaintext retrieval efficiency. In specific, the numerical query is implemented atop order-preserving encryption (OPE) that is perfectly compatible with plaintext indexing techniques. The price for such high efficiency is its vulnerability to inference attacks. Given enough background knowledge, the plaintext can be recovered with high probability. To resist this attack, PriFR injects differential privacy noises into the raw data to offer guaranteed privacy-preserving strength with a negligible extra efficiency cost. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of PriFR.  © 2023 IEEE.","big data; Blockchain; cloud computing; private query; searchable encryption","Big data; Cloud computing; Efficiency; Privacy-preserving techniques; Search engines; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Files retrieval; Keyword search; Large-scales; Plaintext; Privacy preserving; Private query; Retrieval systems; Searchable encryptions; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161800663"

The data transmitted and stored through the network have the risk of privacy leaking. Encrypting the shared data can satisfy the need of the privacy, and retrieving the encrypted data can make the data used efficiently. However, to enable users to retrieve encrypted data and perform fine-grained authorization on their encrypted files is still a great challenge. Although attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) is a well-received solution to the challenge, there are still privacy and efficiency issues if the traditional ABKS schemes are directly used in blockchain data sharing. In order to solve the problems, this article proposes privacy protection data retrieval scheme with an inverted index, which is an application of attribute-based encryption.

An increasing number of companies and individuals have chosen the cloud to store their data. However, accidents, such as cloud server downtime, cloud data loss, and accidental deletion, are serious issues for some applications that need to run around the clock. For some mission and business-critical applications, the continuous availability of outsourcing storage services is also necessary to protect users' outsourced data during downtime. Nevertheless, ensuring the continuous availability of data in public cloud data integrity auditing protocols leads to data privacy issues because auditors can obtain the data content of users by a sufficient number of storage proofs. Therefore, protecting data privacy is a burning issue. In addition, existing data integrity auditing schemes that rely on semi-trusted third-party auditors have several security problems, including single points of failure and performance bottlenecks. To deal with these issues, we propose herein a blockchain-based continuous data integrity checking protocol with zero-knowledge privacy protection. We realize a concrete construction by using a verifiable delay function with high efficiency and proof of retrievability, and prove the security of the proposal in a random oracle model. The proposed construction supports dynamic updates for the outsourced data. We also design smart contracts to ensure fairness among the parties involved. Finally, we implement the protocols, and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications","Blockchain; Continuous availability; Verifiable delay function; Zero-knowledge privacy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138203409"

With the in-depth study of the industrial internet and blockchain technology in recent years, data-sharing based on blockchain has become an important means to achieve industrial internet interconnection and has played an important role in achieving production efficiency and product quality. However, the transparency of blockchain can raise privacy issues, and competitors may engage in malicious competition due to the exposure of blockchain transactions. Therefore, based on the general blockchain system, this article unifies the scale of value of data sharing by introducing a token exchange mechanism as a basis for privacy-preserving mechanisms. Based on smart contracts, a token mixer anonymizes shared participants. By introducing a ring signature scheme with smart contracts, we provide group-oriented authentication for anonymous identities participating in data sharing and ensure data flow within a controlled range. The abovementioned mechanism provides a feasible solution for the privacy-preserving requirement of data sharing among industrial entities and could encourage industrial entities to participate in data sharing, supporting the goals of interconnection in the industrial internet. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","","Authentication; Privacy-preserving techniques; Production efficiency; Smart contract; A-RINGS; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Exchange mechanism; In-depth study; Privacy issue; Privacy preserving; Production efficiency; Products quality; Traditional industry; Blockchain","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150601010"

First, the typical way of handling sensitive information can easily lead to privacy disclosure. Second, the medical system is relatively isolated. It is difficult for one medical system to share data with another, and the scope of users' activities is limited within the system boundary. To solve these two problems, we propose a new privacy-preserving medical data-sharing scheme by introducing the authorization mechanism and attribute-based encryption (ABE) based on blockchain, which breaks system boundaries and realizes data sharing among several medical institutions. ABE is used to realize scalable access control. In addition, doctors can share their knowledge to diagnose users by introducing many-to-many matching, which means that patients' health data can be represented by multiple keywords and doctors' expertise can be represented by multiple interests. We provide the correctness and security analysis of our scheme and implement a prototype tool on Ethereum.

Moreover, the recently permitted blockchain applications suffer from deficient performance and lack of privacy. This study presents a privacy-preserving and secure sharing and storage system for public health centers based on the blockchain method to dispose of these issues.

While the power grid is becoming more intelligent, it is also accompanied by the emergence of various security threats, and the power grid will face greater challenges and pressures. In this paper, aiming at the current situation of information security faced by the power grid blockchain under the cloud Internet of Things, a multi-authorization center ciphertext policy attribute encryption access control method is constructed for the power grid blockchain. It adds the function of visitor attribute update revocation, aggregates multi-dimensional data into ciphertext, and uses CP-ABE encryption to implement fine-grained access control at the dimension level. Through experimental analysis, in terms of security and functionality, this method can resist physical collision attacks and manage access rights flexibly. In terms of encryption and decryption efficiency, the encryption and decryption calculation speed of the proposed method is 6.2-15.6% higher than that of the traditional method, and the time consumption efficiency is more than 5% higher than that of other methods. It proves that this model has more advantages for open network environments such as power grid blockchain with high confidentiality requirements and large scale of users.

This article presents the fruits of this collaboration, highlighting the capabilities and limits of our PET, as well as the challenges we encountered during our interdisciplinary endeavour. In particular, we explore the barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration between law and computer science that we faced, and how these two fields’ different expectations as to what technology can do for data protection law compliance had an impact on the project's development and outcome. We also explore the overstated promises of techno-regulation, and the practical and legal challenges that militate against the implementation of our PET: most industry players have no incentive to deploy it, the transaction costs of running it make it prohibitively expensive, and there are significant clashes between the blockchain's decentralised architecture and GDPR's requirements that hinder its deployability.

Based on sensing-as-a-service in microgrid, sensor owners and sensor data consumers can effectively perform data sharing operations. However, the state-of-the-art sensor data sharing works in microgrid have the following two limitations: (i) cannot support fine-grained authorization for sensor owners and sensor data consumers and (ii) fail to simultaneously consider confidentiality and authenticity for sensor data sharing. To address the problems, in this article, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving sensing data sharing system with fine-grained authorization in microgrid. Technically, we employed attribute-based signature methodology to design a fined-grained authorization mechanism for sensor data users. Moreover, a lightweight hyper elliptic curve-based signcryption scheme is employed to provide confidentiality and authenticity for sensor data sharing. To clarify the feasibility of our proposed system, we implement the system and evaluate the performance.

A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named sensorkey) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the sensorkey to each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer's public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the sensorkey, and one encryption of the sensorkey for each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient sensorkey retrieval from the consortium blockchain. The sensorkey is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes. © 2022","Consortium blockchain; Data sharing; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Wireless sensor network","Data Sharing; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Efficiency; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensor nodes; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Data Sharing; Group key agreement; Multiple data; Multiple organizations; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Sensing data; Sink nodes; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135113560"

A network of peer-to-peer computers called Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) enables decentralized content exchange and storage. As smart contracts allow for the automated and safe execution of established rules and logic, they can improve IPFS functionality when implemented on blockchain networks. This study compares the support for smart contracts on IPFS provided by various blockchain networks. The comparison comprises Polkadot, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Ethereum. When utilized to deploy and carry out smart contracts over IPFS, these networks’ scalability, security, and transaction costs are the main subjects of the study. A thorough literature examination of the various blockchain networks and the elements connected to them, including as consensus methods, gas costs, and IPFS compatibility, forms the basis of the research technique employed in this study. The study’s conclusions show that each blockchain network has different strengths and shortcomings when it comes to enabling smart contracts on IPFS. Despite having higher transaction costs, more established networks like Ethereum and Solana provide greater degrees of security and scalability. Although it has cheaper transaction costs than Ethereum and Solana, Binance Smart Chain is less secure.

The blockchain's data integrity, decentralization, and anonymity opened up new possibilities for addressing the aforementioned issues. Therefore, this paper presents a Blockchain-based Access Control Scheme (BACS) with Multiple Party Authority (MPA), smart contract, and proxy re encryption to secure the EHR. The proposed scheme consists of six phases: the registration phase, appointment phase, data aggregation stage, storage phase, query phase, and validation phase. The medical data is encrypted by using a Lightweight Fused Cryptographic (LFC) algorithm with the signature of the patient and doctor to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The encrypted EHR is then stored on Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS), which is a decentralised file storage platform. Moreover, the developed smart contract verifies the authenticity of the users, provides a reputation score for the oracle, and creates a time seal. This enhances the security of the system from external attacks as well as internal attacks. A security analysis is conducted for the proposed method, and the performance is compared with the existing techniques based on encryption time, decryption time, and computation cost. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Blockchain; Encryption; Medical Data; Oracle; Privacy; Security; Smart Contract","Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Network security; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Encryption schemes; Information technology security; Medical data; Network information technology; Oracle; Privacy; Privacy aware; Security; Smart contract","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147122757"

As an emerging technology, blockchain, with excellent characteristics, can promote the prosperity and development of the data-sharing industry. However, the existing blockchain may lead to some privacy and security issues due to its transparency and lack of supervision. Hence, a secure data sharing model with supervision and privacy protection, named DBSDS, was proposed, which supports illegal content supervision and users revocation, and possesses flexible and fine-grained access control on data sharing. Firstly, it introduces a dual-blockchain architecture, one blockchain is used to ensure the integrity and traceability of private data and another is utilized to supervise illegal users so that they can no longer upload and share private data. Secondly, a key tracing tree was built and correspondingly different key generation strategies for different users were designed, which endows regulators with supervision capabilities. Finally, combined ABPER-KS algorithm, both privacy protection and fine-grained access control on private data can be accomplished. Furthermore, security analysis and performance comparison manifest that DBSDS is safe and owns better performance, and scheme implementation and experimental analysis indicate the practicality of DBSDS. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","dual-blockchain; privacy protection; proxy re-encryption; supervised data sharing","Access control; Crime; Cryptography; Data privacy; Block-chain; Data application; Data Sharing; Dual-blockchain; Fine grained; Privacy protection; Private data; Proxy re encryptions; Security data sharing; Supervised data sharing; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152074212"

In such situations, the enterprise can benefit from the concept of federated learning, in which machine learning models are constructed at various geographic sites. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, namely BDSP, to share data among enterprises based on Blockchain and federated learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a transparency contribution accounting mechanism to estimate the valuation of data and implement a proof-of-concept for further evaluation.

However, centralized learning usually creates issues in terms of data privacy, data control, and data security. To address these issues, decentralized AI, especially federated learning, is proposed to achieve no data sharing or data exchange across servers and decentralized devices. This paper proposes a new decentralized AI paradigm based on blockchain, which goes beyond the decentralized federated learning to require no model pooling or orchestrating on any central server. That is, we propose further decentralization by dismissing the central or-chestrator in federated learning through the usage of blockchain (e.g., Ethereum in this paper), which is inherently a decentralized, distributed, peer-to-peer and autonomous mechanism. We implemented a prototype to demonstrate the idea, in which models are trained on data contributors' ends. Instead of moving models to a central place for combining (such as in federated learning), models are trained independently on data contributors' sides, and flow to the decentralized blockchain for updating. In this process, smart contracts on Ethereum provide specifications required for model creation. In addition, data contributors are rewarded Ether coins for their contributions to train the model with their data. This also incentivizes data contributors to provide data for AI training while protecting their data privacy.  © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Data privacy","Artificial intelligence; Data privacy; Electronic data interchange; Ethereum; Learning systems; Block-chain; Central servers; Centralised; Centralized server; Data contributors; Data control; Data Sharing; Decentralisation; Decentralised; Model training; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152006457"

Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that has diverse application scenarios in the medical field. Blockchain technology relies on traditional cryptography to ensure data integrity and verifiability, but the creation of quantum computing has made it possible to break traditional encryption and signature methods. Therefore, quantum blockchain can provide a higher level of security for handling medical data. This paper innovatively designs a new medical data processing system based on quantum blockchain (QB-IMD). In QB-IMD, a quantum blockchain structure and a novel electronic medical record algorithm (QEMR) are proposed to ensure that the processed data is legitimate and tamper-proof. QEMR combines quantum signature and quantum identity authentication to avoid the potential security risks of digital signatures. In addition, through delegated computing by quantum cloud, medical diagnostic data can be computed without leaking to quantum cloud servers, thus protecting user privacy. Through mathematical proof, theoretical analysis and simulation, it is demonstrated that our scheme can resist six attacks and is feasible to protect user privacy.

However, their widespread use also poses significant challenges, such as public safety, privacy, and cybersecurity. Cyberattacks, targeting UAVs have become more frequent, which highlights the need for robust security solutions. Blockchain technology, the foundation of cryptocurrencies has the potential to address these challenges. This study suggests a platform that utilizes blockchain technology to manage drone operations securely and confidentially. By incorporating blockchain technology, the proposed method aims to increase the security and privacy of drone data. The suggested platform stores information on a public blockchain located on Ethereum and leverages the Ganache platform to ensure secure and private blockchain transactions. The MetaMask wallet for Ethbalance is necessary for BCT transactions. The present research finding shows that the proposed approach’s efficiency and security features are superior to existing methods. This study contributes to the development of a secure and efficient system for managing drone operations that could have significant applications in various industries. The proposed platform’s security measures could mitigate privacy concerns, minimize cyber security risk, and enhance public safety, ultimately promoting the widespread adoption of UAVs.

To enhance the precision of diagnosis, different participants in SHNs share health data that contain sensitive information. Therefore, the data exchange process raises privacy concerns, especially when the integration of health data from multiple sources (linkage attack) results in further leakage. Linkage attack is a type of dominant attack in the privacy domain, which can leverage various data sources for private data mining. Furthermore, adversaries launch poisoning attacks to falsify the health data, which leads to misdiagnosing or even physical damage. To protect private health data, we propose a personalized differential privacy model based on the trust levels among users. The trust is evaluated by a defined community density, while the corresponding privacy protection level is mapped to controllable randomized noise constrained by differential privacy. To avoid linkage attacks in personalized differential privacy, we design a noise correlation decoupling mechanism using a Markov stochastic process. In addition, we build the community model on a blockchain, which can mitigate the risk of poisoning attacks during differentially private data transmission over SHNs. Extensive experiments and analysis on real-world datasets have testified the proposed model, and achieved better performance compared with existing research from perspectives of privacy protection and effectiveness. © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.","blockchain; differential privacy; edge intelligence; personalized privacy preservation; Smart Healthcare Networks (SHNs)","Data Analytics; Data mining; Electronic data interchange; Health care; Random processes; Sensitive data; Stochastic systems; Block-chain; Differential privacies; Edge intelligence; Health data; Personalized privacy preservation; Poisoning attacks; Privacy preservation; Privacy protection; Private data; Smart healthcare network; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171179242"

First, to achieve fairness for trading participants, by incorporating attribute-based credentials, encryption, and zero-knowledge proof, we design a data trading scheme where a buyer first publishes the required data attributes on the blockchain, and a data seller can demonstrate data availability in ciphertext by only disclosing the required attributes to a data buyer and proving the authenticity of data. A data buyer transfers funds only if the correct key material is uploaded to the blockchain. Second, to guarantee fine-grained data trading and preserve identity privacy, we build a Merkle hash tree on the ciphertexts of data with a signature on its root node, which allows a data seller to split data into blocks and remove the sensitive information from the data without affecting data availability verification. The public key of the data seller is not leaked to the data buyer during the trading. Moreover, different trading transactions from the same data seller cannot be linked. We formally prove that our scheme achieves the desired security properties: fairness and privacy preservation.

As locking medical data in a single healthcare center causes information isolation, healthcare centers are motivated to build medical data sharing systems. However, existing systems highly rely on the trusted centralized servers, which are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and the single point of failure. Moreover, it is a non-trivial matter to authorize multiple users to search and access EHR in a privacy-preserving manner. In this article, we propose MedShare, a decentralized framework for secure EHR sharing. Our design utilizes the smart contract technique of blockchain to establish a trusted platform for healthcare centers to share their encrypted EHR. Considering that fine-grained access control is essential in practical EHR sharing service, we devise a constant-size attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, where the access policy is embedded in search result on the blockchain. Besides, we propose an efficient scheme that enables authorized MedShare users to perform multi-keyword boolean search operations over encrypted EHR. We formally analyze the security strengths and implement the system prototype on Ethereum.

A supply chain management system for agriculture is proposed and implemented in this paper to meet the confidentiality requirements of sensitive data and data ownership requirements. In a public blockchain environment, users can transparently verify every block generated at runtime and easily access data hosted on shared storage without authorization. To improve key distribution efficiency, we developed a proxy re-encryption scheme to manage the symmetric keys of encrypted data on shared storage. Blockchain services should improve the availability of persistent data. The interplanetary File System is used as a storage backend and to provide a file-based database that combined IPFS and a blockchain. Access control is a necessary function in the framework of multi-user data exchange. Users can manage permissions based on any data set in the Access Control List model using smart contracts that are defined by data owners. Finally, we demonstrate the system by developing a management application and integrating it into an existing food traceability system with a decoupled architecture. This demonstrates the system's ability to adapt to open data services while establishing a reliable hybrid architecture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Access control; Blockchain; Data sharing; Distributed file system; Food traceability; Privacy; Proxy re-encryption; Smart farm","Authorization; Data Sharing; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Supply chain management; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Distributed file systems; Filesystem; Food traceabilitys; Privacy; Proxy re encryptions; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Shared storage; Smart farm; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167665485"

Aiming at the problems of trust and single point of failure in the existing protection schemes, this paper proposes an AMI security framework based on blockchain. By combining the characteristics of blockchain such as decentration, tamper proof, traceability, the architecture of AMI data management system is reshaped. The technologies of peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithm and smart contract of blockchain are used to solve the problems of secure storage, transmission and application of AMI data.

Vehicle and driving data are often used to mine information about people's lifestyles and preferences. Without advanced data encryption and strict authorization measures, personal privacy and security are at great risk. To solve the problem that the relatively low security of vehicles connected to the Internet may threaten the privacy of users, a blockchain-based sensitive data privacy-protection scheme for vehicles connected to the Internet is proposed. First, association rules are used to mine Big Data in the Internet of Vehicles. Then, a data security aggregation protocol is established. Finally, an end-to-end encryption mechanism is created. The privacy protection of Big Data in the Internet of Vehicles is achieved through static and dynamic strategies. The experimental results show that the scheme can improve the hiding rate of sensitive data, the key generation time and encryption time are shorter than those of typical technologies, and the encryption ability is better.

Despite being beneficial, these applications are massively relying on gathering sensitive information from the mobile devices, which creates numerous challenges regarding security and latency problems. For instance, these applications’ stakeholders take their time to select mobile device for gathering necessary resources. Therefore, this process of recruiting mobile devices will not be practical with sensing information which has an expiration date, which the time of collecting and recruiting these types of sensing information are surpassing its expiration date. As device-to-device (D2D) paradigms have been established as relevant communication for sharing sensing information in a low latency and minimum cost, it still suffers from mobility problems. Hence, mobile edge caching (MEC) system has been developed to increase efficiency of information sharing with mobility of high-flexibility. Nonetheless this paradigm has some challenges with regards to constructing a satisfactory resource sharing system concerning security and trust ability. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel security and privacy blockchain sharing (SPB-DS) system based on MEC system. A searchable keyword will be recorded on the system's blockchain for every sensing information and all requester devices that require to download specific sensing information, it will generate a trapdoor first for looking for the matching keyword in the blockchain system. To incentive provider devices an optimal payment mechanism has been developed for those who wish to partake in the system. An analysis of security demonstrates that the suggested protocol can satisfy many security goals, while an evaluation on performance illustrates high feasibility and scalability of the MEC system's proposed scheme. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Payment; Privacy; Security; Sharing data","Information dissemination; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sensitive data; Block-chain; Caching system; Data Sharing; Edge caching; Multiple services; Payment; Privacy; Security; Sensing information; Sharing schemes; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172289993"

Although moving data to a server is a useful solution for storage, the owner of the data loses control, which results in security lapses. An efficient method for cloud-based data models is data integrity. In order to protect data privacy in IoT healthcare, this paper develops a data integrity technique. The Data Owner, IoT server, Key Generator Center, and Auditor are the four entities that make up this model. Here, the ability to verify the accuracy of the outsourced data is present in the auditor, data owner, and IoT server. The setup, storage, and verification phase are the three stages that make up the data integrity model. Here, the proposed Taylor-based Border Collie Cat optimisation is used to generate integrity keys in the best possible way.

In the data security system, the quality measure can be validate by means of the size of key that are used for the encryption process. Combined with the blockchain, the encryption model is to be improved for the solve the problem in data security system. This also needs to focus on the size reduction of data storage due to the large key size of encrypted data. In the proposed work, Intuitionistic Derivative Symmetrical Encryption (IDSE) Algorithm based security algorithm along with blockchain function was integrated to form the authorized data storage and transmission process. For the key pattern generation, Differential Hashing Pattern (DHP) based key pattern extraction model was used for high speed data transmission and to reduce the size of data that are encrypted. The features that are considered for the appropriate security system are the data transmission pattern with respect to the time and the hashing model of key generation.

Cloud computing technology can help the sector handle heterogeneous sources of data and the effective convergence of data. Due to security and privacy considerations, it is challenging to transfer a medical record from multiple hospital databases. Consequently, the article proposed a blockchain-based patient information management system by using the Blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Robust Healthcare data (BPPRH). This transfers the medical data to the patient through the cloud more securely. The cloud is modelled with the hypervisor and VMs. During the data transmission or storage in the cloud, there are several attacks like ransomware, malicious insiders, Man-in-the-middle attack, malware injection attacks, and Denial-of-Service attacks (DoS) occur in the network. Modified Fuzzy Particle Swarm Optimization (MFPSO) is presented to detect these threats. After detecting the attacks, Edge-Cloud-based Collaborative Systems (ECCS) prevent the data from attackers with the use of Regularized Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Inverse Network, and Shadow Model Reconstruction models. The results showed that the system provides better security with high accuracy of 99.32% respectively.

Due to the openness of the network, the UAV cluster is more vulnerable to passive eavesdropping, active interference, and other attacks, which makes the system face serious security threats. This paper proposes a Blockchain-Based Data Acquisition (BDA) scheme with privacy protection to address the data privacy and identity authentication problems in the UAV-assisted data acquisition scenario. Each UAV cluster has an aggregate unmanned aerial vehicle (AGV) that can batch-verify the acquisition reports within its administrative domain. After successful verification, AGV adds its signcrypted ciphertext to the aggregation and uploads it to the blockchain for storage. There are two chains in the blockchain that store the public key information of registered entities and the aggregated reports, respectively. The security analysis shows that the BDA construction can protect the privacy and authenticity of acquisition data, and effectively resist a malicious key generation center and the public-key substitution attack. It also provides unforgeability to acquisition reports under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) assumption. The performance analysis demonstrates that compared with other schemes, the proposed BDA construction has lower computational complexity and is more suitable for the UAV cluster network with limited computing power and storage capacity. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

In addition, patients do not want their medical data to be leaked during the sharing process. Researchers have employed blockchain to build data-sharing systems to address these issues. However, current systems do not restrict the power of participants, nor do they prevent visitors from sharing the obtained data to unauthorized parties. To address these issues, we propose a private data-sharing system with symmetric encryption for the medical industry that implements power restriction and access control, and prevents the leakage of private data. To be specific, firstly, symmetric encryption algorithm is utilized to encrypt medical data to protect the privacy of data owner. Secondly, our proposed system is built on a new blockchain framework, in which only visitors with permission can access the medical data. Thirdly, we employ chameleon signature to prevent visitors from sharing data with other parties without permission. Finally, we make the power of participants in the system revocable to prevent them from abusing their power. Our proposed system has been proven to be secure through security analysis and can protect the privacy of patients. In addition, the experimental results show that our system has excellent performance in terms of time overhead compared to other systems. © 2023 by the authors.","access control; blockchain; medical data sharing; power supervision","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160283893"

Such raw data needs to be stored and accessed from a non-proprietary database while the obfuscation and encryption techniques on current cloud-based proprietary solutions incur data losses that are deemed inefficient for accurate usage, particularly in time-sensitive real-time operations. In this paper, we target the problem of scalably storing and retrieving potentially sensitive data generated by vehicles and propose TREAD, a blockchain-based system comprising smart contracts to store this mobility data on a distributed ledger such that multiple peers can access and utilize it in different location-based applications while not revealing users’ sensitive personal information. It is, however, challenging to scalably store large amounts of constantly generated trajectories, and to achieve scalability we leverage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a scalable distributed peer-to-peer data storage system. To avoid users injecting malicious/fake trajectories into the ledger, we develop efficient consensus algorithms for the stakeholders to validate the storage and retrieval process in a distributed manner. We implemented TREAD on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform using trajectory data generated for 700 vehicles in a simulation environment well calibrated with vehicle trajectories from a real-world test-bed in New York City.

Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time. Furthermore, we carry out an extensive analysis to show the high security and efficiency of our proposed scheme. Finally, we build a Quorum consortium blockchain on the Tencent Cloud and deploy smart contracts on the chain to simulate transactions in our scheme. The experiment results indicate the proposed scheme achieves good feasibility. © 2022 Duo Zhang et al.","","Access control; Data Sharing; Distributed ledger; Forestry; Information dissemination; Privacy-preserving techniques; Smart contract; Access policies; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Information sharing; Medical data; Medical institutions; Medical record; Personal privacy; Privacy preserving; Sensitive informations; Digital storage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131184483"

As a result, Federated Learning (FL) (also called collaborative learning) has emerged as a new training paradigm that allows multiple, geographically distributed nodes to learn a Deep Learning (DL) model together without sharing their data. Blockchain is becoming a new trend as data protection and privacy are concerns in many sectors. Technology is leading the world and transforming into a global village where everything is accessible and transparent. We have presented a blockchain enabled security model using FL that can generate an enhanced DL model without sharing data and improve privacy through higher security and access rights to data. However, existing FL approaches also have unique security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit and compromise the trained model. The FL method is compared to the other known approaches. Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users’ data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Blockchain-assisted data aggregation enables the traceability of sensing data to improve the trustworthiness of data aggregation results. However, directly using blockchains for data aggregation may introduce the risk of privacy leakage because all nodes, including malicious nodes, can access the data on blockchains. In this paper, we propose a grouping-based reliable privacy-preserving data aggregation (RPPDA) method using private blockchains for mobile crowdsensing. First, the sensing nodes are divided into multiple groups, and each group maintains a private blockchain to store the data aggregation records, which avoids the leakage of the aggregated results and ensures the traceability of the sensory data. Then, a zero-sum noise-adding mechanism is utilized to not only preserve the private information during aggregation and ensure the correctness of the aggregated results but also improve the efficiency of privacy preservation. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the correctness, privacy, efficiency, and reliability of the proposed RPPDA algorithm.

In this study, we propose a blockchain-assisted secure storage scheme for logistics data. To be specific, this scheme can be briefly divided into two parts. The first part involves data generation and aggregation, session establishing, records encryption and storage, wherein a blockchain network is used to assist the cloud server with data storage, and smart contracts are deployed to provide reliable storage interfaces. In the second part, an efficient consensus mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of the consensus process. Also, the stored records can be securely audited by leveraging the deployed blockchain network. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of this scheme and evaluate its performance in terms of computation and communication overhead by developing an experimental platform.

Block chain is a relatively new and widely accepted kind of decentralized, distributed computing. The advantages of block chain technology are improved security and privacy, decreased expenses, enhanced speed, and consistency. Block chain has applications in a variety of areas, including IT, healthcare, finance, and educational institutions. For data storage, many organizations now adopt centralised cloud systems. Educational Institutes stored and shared their digitally stored data with other institutes or Vendors for various purposes like issuing certificate, so protecting the privacy while sharing the data is a problem of researchers. People create a large number of files every day and wish to save them somewhere. However, they usually rely on unsecure centralized systems. Block chain is a decentralized system that keeps files and data safe. The suggested model will eliminate all cloud storage limits. It uses a block chain and an interplanetary file system to operate. It divides educational data files into blocks and then encrypts each block with hash keysOur goal is to come up with a privacy-preserving method for sharing data via block chain.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set.  © 2022 IEEE.","","Access control; Data privacy; Machine learning; Audit trails; Block-chain; Data confidentiality; Data Sharing; Data systems; Data users; Sensitive application; Trusted execution environments; Trusted party; User privacy; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140912077"

Notably in the COVID era, inner personal and private information is being shared between healthcare providers regarding the medical supply chain. In recent years, multiple cyber-attacks have targeted medical supply chain communication networks due to their lack of security measures. In the era where cyber-attacks are cheaper and easier due to the computational power and various algorithms available for malicious uses, security, and data privacy requires intensive and higher measures. On the other hand, Information Hiding Techniques (IHT) compromise various advanced methods to hide sensitive information from being disclosed to malicious nodes. Moreover, with the support of Blockchain, IHT can bring higher security and the required privacy levels.

However, since cloud systems are centralized, there is serious concern about data security and privacy. Blockchain technology is viewed as a promising method of dealing with privacy issues and data security because of its exclusive features of distributed ledgers, secrecy, verifiability, and enhanced security. The literature review has shown significant works on integrating blockchain technology with cloud system for managing and sharing healthcare data. It has been analyzed that previous works are primarily dependent on the centralized data storage approach, which raises privacy concerns. The previous works also do not emphasize handling big medical data and lack the reliability of the end-to-end security features system. This paper has presented an authorization framework for ensuring data security and privacy preservation using blockchain technology with IPFS as decentralized file storage and sharing system. The proposed study devises a proof of replication algorithm using smart contracts to provide a better access control mechanism.

However, provenance graphs have the graph structure containing sensitive information including the records as well as the linkages between the records. Both need to be kept secret from the unauthorized users including the blockchain peers. Storing the record linkages on blockchain in a privacy-preserving manner is challenging because (1) past records cannot be modified due to the tamper-proofness, (2) efficient graph tracking/tracing on blockchain is necessary for a provenance system on blockchain, and (3) the size of the records' pointer may leak the volume of linkages. Existing approaches either fail to provide linkage privacy protection to the provenance graph, could only support less-complicated structure such as tree, or leak the volume of linkages from the block sizes. We present Trac2Chain, a framework that provides complete linkage privacy as well as full tracking/tracing functions for the provenance graphs stored on blockchain. The novel graph storage design in Trac2Chain allows generation of the provenance dependencies of arbitrary graph structure while still enjoying the tamper-proofness of blockchain. The evaluation and comparison show that Trac2Chain achieves the best functionality and privacy guarantees among the state-of-the-art approaches and has comparable overhead. © 2022 ACM.","access control; blockchain; linkage privacy; provenance","Access control; Digital storage; Graphic methods; Privacy-preserving techniques; Trees (mathematics); Block-chain; Building applications; Decentralised; Graph data; Graph structures; Linkage privacy; Property; Provenance; Sensitive informations; Unauthorized users; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130355062"

Mostly, the records are stored on healthcare cloud and application (HCA) servers, and thus, are subjected to end-user latency, extensive computations, single-point failures, and security and privacy risks. A joint solution is required to address the issues of responsive analytics, coupled with high data ingestion in HBD and secure EHR access. Motivated from the research gaps, the paper proposes a scheme, that integrates blockchain (BC)-based confidentiality-privacy (CP) preserving scheme, CP-BDHCA, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC)-based digital signature framework, HCA-ECC is proposed to establish a session key for secure communication among different healthcare entities. Then, in the second phase, a two-step authentication framework is proposed that integrates Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES), named as HCA-RSAE that safeguards the ecosystem against possible attack vectors. CP-BDAHCA is compared against existing HCA cloud applications in terms of parameters like response time, average delay, transaction and signing costs, signing and verifying of mined blocks, and resistance to DoS and DDoS attacks. We consider 10 BC nodes and create a real-world customized dataset to be used with SEER dataset. The dataset has 30,000 patient profiles, with 1000 clinical accounts. Based on the combined dataset the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes like AI4SAFE, TEE, Secret, and IIoTEED, with a lower response time. For example, the scheme has a very less response time of 300 ms in DDoS. The average signing cost of mined BC transactions is 3,34 seconds, and for 205 transactions, has a signing delay of 1405 ms, with improved accuracy of ≈ 12% than conventional state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","Big Data; Blockchain; DoS and DDoS attacks; ECC signatures; Healthcare Cloud and Applications; pairing-based cryptography; secure session key management","Big Data; Blockchain; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Delivery of Health Care; Ecosystem; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Privacy; Authentication; Big data; Blockchain; Cryptography; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Network security; Privacy by design; Advanced Encryption Standard; Cloud applications; Denial of Service; Electronic health record; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy; Single point failure; State-of-the-art approach; adult; article; big data; blockchain; cloud computing; confidentiality; controlled study; denial of service attack; ecosystem; electronic health record; encryption; human; ingestion; medical service; privacy; reaction time; computer security; confidentiality; ecosystem; health care delivery; privacy; Denial-of-service attack","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110818554"

While extant studies focus on cryptography and differential privacy, few of them capture the utility and authenticity of data. As a result, data privacy remains the primary concern when training a machine learning (ML) model with IoMT data from various data sources/owners such as k − medoids. To overcome the above-mentioned issues, this study proposes secure ​k − medoids ​that are implemented together with Blockchain and partial homomorphic cryptosystem (Paillier) to ensure authenticity and protect all entities (i.e., data owner and data analyst) data privacy. The homomorphic property of Paillier is utilized to develop secure building blocks (i.e., secure polynomial operations, secure comparison, and secure biasing operations) to ensure data privacy and eliminate dependency on any third parties. We utilized three different biomedical datasets, and these are (I) Heart Disease Data (HDD), (II) Diabetes Data (DD), and (III) Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data (BCWD). Rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure ​k − medoids ​protect against sensitive data breaches.

The remarkable security feature of the blockchain is that the blockchain verifies the transaction initiated on each block through the node, and its process is broadcast throughout the whole network to let everyone know. On the one hand, this ensures the security of every transaction, but on the other hand, it is easy to cause privacy disclosure problems for transaction users. Therefore, under the premise of ensuring the security of the blockchain, it has become a hot issue to protect the sensitive information of transaction users. A check-in privacy protection (CPP) algorithm based on check-in location generalization is proposed in this paper, which can be applied to blockchain transactions to solve the privacy leakage problem of transaction users' sensitive information. CPP algorithm not only protects the privacy of check-in data but also keeps the high utility of trajectory pattern data. Firstly, location types are recommended in the sensitive check-in location generalization based on the user's trajectory pattern by using Markov chain technology. Secondly, to make sure that the generalized locations can be scattered as much as possible to prevent the attacker from deducing back, a heuristic rule is designed to select the generalized location based on the recommended location types, and at the same time, the similarity between the anonymous trajectory and the original trajectory is maintained. In addition, a generalized location search strategy is designed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Based on the real spatial-temporal check-in data, the results of the experiment indicate that our algorithm can effectively protect the privacy of sensitive check-in while ensuring the high utility of trajectory pattern data. © 2022 Xiufeng Xia et al.","","Location; Markov processes; Privacy-preserving techniques; Trajectories; Block-chain; Check-in; Digital tokens; Financial industry; Generalisation; Pattern datum; Privacy protection; Protection algorithms; Sensitive informations; Trajectory pattern; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127845776"

For sharing the traffic data with other vehicles, the vehicular sensory data are usually uploaded to the cloud server. However, existing data sharing systems for VANETs cannot provide selective data with sufficient privacy protection. Moreover, some schemes also cannot ensure stable data accessibility and the integrity of retrieved data. On the other hand, with the improvements such as lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth, 5G technology brings more possibilities to future applications. The join of the software-defined networks (SDNs) also offers efficient and effective network management. This paper proposes a primitive vehicular communication system named blockchain-based privacy-preserving and sustainable data query service. The proposed scheme is designed to realize stable data accessibility by leveraging smart contracts and blockchain oracle. With the help of 5G technology and P2P file-sharing system, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the proposed scheme aims to support video downloading files with searchable capability and fairness. An incentive token mechanism is also equipped. The merit of auditability is ensured by Ethereum blockchain platform to support the accountability. Besides, we also evaluate its networking performance via SUMO and NS-3 simulators.

In such scenarios, due to low data handling capabilities, limited storage, and security aspects, it is quite challenging to protect networks against illegal information access and utilizes storage efficiently. Though researchers provide various solutions for security and data storage, but a few solutions are appropriate for wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-enabled IoTs. Therefore, a blockchain-based decentralized framework integrated with authentication and privacy-preserving schemes is developed for the secure communication in WSNs-enabled IoTs. Registration, certification, and revocation process are employed for the communication with sensor nodes and base station (BS) in a cloud computing environment. In this scheme cluster heads forward the collected information to the BS. Consequently, BS records all the key parameters on the distributed blockchain and large data is forwarded to clouds for the storage. The revoked certificates of all malicious nodes are eliminated from blockchain by BS. The performance of the proposed scheme is scrutinized in terms of detection accuracy, certification delay, computational, and communicational overheads. The simulated results, comparative analysis, and security validation support the superiority of the proposed solution over the existing approaches.  © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; distributed; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy and authentication; security; wireless sensor network (WSN)","Blockchain; Digital storage; Internet of things; Network security; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensor nodes; Block-chain; Data storage; Distributed; Handling capability; Internet of thing; Limited storage; Privacy and authentication; Security; Sensing devices; Wireless sensor network; Authentication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136115660"

However, many challenges inhibit the development of using IoT applications in smart cities, such as issues of privacy, scalability, trust, security, and centralisation. On a daily basis in smart cities, the IoT generates a large amount of data (big data) which could potentially be used for questionable or suspect purposes by attackers. The weight of the security issues surrounding big data must be acknowledged as the associated technology is continuously developing. To solve this issue, a strategy that secures important and potentially sensitive user information on a distributed blockchain and transmits non-sensitive information to the primary system by controlling the size of the blockchain is proposed. This solution cannot be achieved in traditional blockchain because it requires too many resources. The model is composed of three proposed algorithms: the first aims to allocate data to each user; the second performs the process of searching for data, and the third confirms the communication process. Experiments have proved that this proposed protocol for blockchain has excellent byzantine fault tolerance. The final experimental results of the proposed model established that the algorithms effectively meet the performance requirements. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Moreover, the in-depth research and development of 6G and AI technology further strengthen the interconnection of various entities in VANET and can realize edge intelligence, which fundamentally enhances the efficiency of data sharing. However, reliable transmission and secure storage of data have always been a great challenge in data sharing. Although some schemes store shared data in the blockchain, most of the consensus mechanisms they use employ full nodes to verify signature information and timestamps, which cannot effectively judge the reliability of the shared data itself. Some other schemes use scoring mechanisms to evaluate data uploaded by vehicles, but these methods can be affected by network hardware failures and cannot effectively detect duplicate data. In addition, participants' privacy may also be disclosed in the process of data sharing, such as participants' location and identity information. Therefore, to address the above problems, this paper proposes a data sharing scheme in 6G-VANET, which can not only ensure the reliability and security of shared data but also protect the privacy of participants. Firstly, a consortium chain is adopted to realize the secure storage of shared data in 6G-VANET, which meets the requirements of tamper-proof and traceability of data. Secondly, a voting consensus mechanism is designed in combination with smart contract to ensure the reliability of data. Thirdly, the trained word2vec natural language processing model is deployed to edge nodes to realize edge intelligence, effectively eliminate the duplicate shared data, and enhance storage efficiency. Finally, a participant privacy protection mechanism is designed using the Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol, and a secure and efficient data sharing scheme is finally realized. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by security analysis and experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the time and space overhead of blockchain can meet the practical requirements, and the proposed PSI protocol of large-scale vehicles can be completed in a short time.  © 2022 Zhihua Wang et al.","","Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Intelligent systems; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Reliability; Storage efficiency; Vehicles; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Edge intelligence; Intersection protocols; Privacy protection; Secure storage; Set intersection; Shared data; Sharing schemes; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Vehicular ad hoc networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135259035"

It enables the connection of numerous heterogeneous devices and sensors into the internet network through the utilization of revolutionary techniques that transfer the manufacturing paradigm to intelligent processes. The traditional industrial internet of things adopts centralized architectures and complex encryption algorithms that suffer from several cyber-security threats and lead to data leakage, privacy disclosure, and high computational and communicational costs. In our work, we proposed a decentralized, efficient, low-power, scalable, secure, privacy-preserving, and trusting architecture based on a private blockchain network/smart contract and interplanetary file system technology for the Al-NajafyIraq oil refinery factory. That enables autonomous working and provides a high level of security authentication and privacy preservation, P2P communication, remote access, immutability and information backtracking. Traditional blockchain technology has storage limitation issues, most recent works adopted external servers or the cloud for storage purposes. Our proposed scheme addresses the limitations of blockchain data storage by adopting an interplanetary file system (IPFS) network; provides an efficient data encryption mechanism at the perceptual layer by adopting a lightweight encryption algorithm, high-performance, and ultra-low-power consumption ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. In addition, our architecture succeeds in merging blockchain technology, IoTs, and an IPFS with the oil refinery as an industrial application area.

Data stored in each of the healthcare institution remain in silos which cannot be easily shared with other institutions due to technical and infrastructural constraints. Hospitals do not have an effective and secure data sharing mechanism leading to monetary and resource loss in the case of a person visiting different hospitals. Blockchain, a disruptive technology with secure and reliable decentralized framework, and can be used to circumvent problems in traditional healthcare architecture for secure storage, sharing and retrieval of Electronic Health Records (EHR). A blockchain-based framework integrated with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for EHR in healthcare management has been proposed in this paper. This proposed framework will enable healthcare institutions to maintain fail-safe and tamper-proof healthcare ledgers in a decentralized manner. Hospitals and doctors act as lightweight nodes, whereas patient nodes can be full or lightweight nodes. The model proposes two-factor authentication and multi-factor authentication for preventing fake node attacks. Patient-centric access model allows the patients to act as digital stewards for their health data, allowing access to doctors and hospitals on demand and revoking it after stipulated time. Symmetric key encryption (AES-128) is used for encrypting data before storing into IPFS. Asymmetric encryption (RSA-4096) is used for generating digital envelopes to pass on symmetric key to authorized entities. Digital signatures (RSA-1024) make sure that the transactions are valid and from authorized nodes. Hashing of the encrypted data is done using SHA-256 algorithm. Multiple layers of security implemented in this model makes sure that adversaries cannot obtain data stored in IPFS; even if they retrieve the data, it will not be meaningful since it is encrypted. The proposed framework for off-chain storage of health data using IPFS saves blockchain structure from scalability issues. Further the proposal for blockchain integration with IPFS helps preserve privacy in the healthcare system, making it highly secure, scalable and robust. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Blockchain data security; Decentralized healthcare data; Electronic health records; Healthcare data security","Authentication; Client server computer systems; Cryptography; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Network security; Records management; Block-chain; Blockchain data security; Data security and privacy; Decentralised; Decentralized healthcare data; Filesystem; Health data; Healthcare data security; Healthcare institutions; Healthcare systems; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126923855"

Additionally, healthcare data is highly regulated by US & EU privacy and security laws and international laws governing data storage in the cloud. The value of healthcare data and these regulatory requirements have motivated organizations to use blockchain to protect data. Blockchain will facilitate effective data exchange while maintaining patient privacy and data protection. Cloud data has long been a draw for cyber attackers. Today, cloud health data has been their latest interest. The cloud-based application that theoretically transforms the operation and communication of existing healthcare networks is EHR. The EHR is a digital file comprising the personal details of citizens/patients (name, photo, address, age, etc.) and health (existing diseases, previous surgeries, allergies, blood type, allergies, vaccinations, etc.). Maximizing cost efficiency is one of the drivers for integrating cloud services in health care. The return on investment for healthcare services is better when using cloud solutions. The cloud infrastructure includes a centralized medical record entry point, allowing many clinicians to display laboratory reports or consult patient notes. Loud technologies would allow researchers to explore these data and analyses public health more accurately. Cloud technology is not the best way to handle the medical services and records of the healthcare system. Nevertheless, this technology allows patients and physicians access to software that will enhance patient care. The Cloud also provides an excellent opportunity to utilize patient data on a health computer scale to draw insights on health and allow patients to manage personal details quickly and efficiently. There are hurdles in introducing emerging technologies and threatening privacy violations, but health services will utilize this increasingly growing and valuable technology with the appropriate training and framework.

Hence, a suitable IoT data market needs to be established, and the provision of safe and effective trading services for multiple buyers and sellers is required. This paper introduces an IoT data market framework supported by blockchain. It focuses on a transaction realization scheme for multiple buyers and sellers. In the scheme, the mechanisms are designed to determine the corresponding data providers and recipients for the buyers and sellers, respectively, and the transaction prices of both parties. When the data market runs, an inference attack will raise bid information leakage issues. We study a transaction scheme that enables differential privacy protection of bids based on an exponential mechanism. This paper theoretically proves the individual rationality, weak budget balance, and truthfulness of the normal transaction scheme and differential privacy-based transaction scheme.

This shift in paradigm introduces a shift in the privacy and security problems that need to be addressed. While a decentralized implementation avoids the single point of failure problem that typically applies to centralized approaches, it is subject to other threats, such as external monitoring, and new challenges, such as the complexity of providing decentralized implementations for data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a solution for privacy-aware distributed data mining on wireless sensor networks. Our solution uses a permissioned blockchain to avoid a single point of failure in the system. Contracts are used to construct an onion-like structure encompassing the Hoeffding trees and a route. The onion-routed query conceals the network identity of the sensors from external adversaries, and obfuscates the actual computation to hide it from internally compromised nodes. We validate our solution on a use case related to an air quality-monitoring sensor network. We compare the quality of our model against traditional models to support the feasibility and viability of the solution. © 2022 by the authors.

However, despite increased attention to the security of electronic health records, patient privacy is still at risk for data breaches. Thus, it is quite a challenge to involve an access control system especially if the patient's medical data are accessible by users who have diverse privileges in different situations. Blockchain is a new technology that can be adopted for decentralized access control management issues. Nevertheless, different scalability, security, and privacy challenges affect this technology. To address these issues, we suggest a novel Decentralized Self-Management of data Access Control (DSMAC) system using a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model for privacy-preserving medical data, empowering patients with mechanisms to preserve control over their personal information and allowing them to self-grant access rights to their medical data. DSMAC leverages smart contracts to conduct Role-based Access Control policies and adopts the implementation of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to describe advanced access control techniques for emergency cases. Finally, by evaluating performance and comparing analyses with other schemes, DSMAC can satisfy the privacy requirements of medical systems in terms of privacy, scalability, and sustainability, and offers a new approach for emergency cases.  © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; data privacy; decentralized access control; decentralized identifier (DID); IoMT sensors; self sovereign identity (SSI); smart contract; verifiable credential (VC)","Access control; Blockchain; Health risks; Information management; Medical information systems; mHealth; Mobile telecommunication systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Scalability; Block-chain; Data access control; Decentralised; Decentralized access control; Decentralized identifier; IoMT sensor; Medical data; Self management; Self sovereign identity; Verifiable credential; Smart contract","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139447854"

AR integrates the digital visuals into a virtual space that emulates the real-world feedback for the user. It supports a range of haptic and interactive communication and thus has attracted the interest of the research community to provide useful AR frameworks. However, as the user-private data is communicated through open channels, it raises privacy and security concerns. In parallel, decentralized computing has shifted resource provisioning to near device interactions that support the real-time connectivity of AR. To preserve privacy and induce trust among AR stakeholders, blockchain (BC)-based AR use cases are presented by researchers. However, the existing surveys have not focused on reference architectures and implementation challenges. Motivated by the research gap, the paper presents a systematic survey of the integration of BC to induce data privacy in AR ecosystems. A comparative analysis is presented, and the potential application of BC-based AR is discussed. A case study on VoRtex enterprise is presented, and a supporting architectural framework is discussed. The survey intends to present the readers deep insights about BC adoption in AR that would motivate industry practitioners, academicians and researchers to propose scalable BC-integrated solutions in AR/VR-based ecosystems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","6G; Augmented reality; Blockchain; Data privacy; Security","Augmented reality; Data privacy; Ecosystems; Surveys; 6g; Block-chain; Communication infrastructure; Haptic communications; Interactivity; It supports; Real-world; Security; Virtual spaces; Wireless communications; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128875977"

To balance the utility and the privacy of data, the existing approaches usually adopt the privacy-preserving signature technology, where the privacy-preserving data are classified by a designated converter (data processor) interacting with a semihonest verifier (data center). However, for the malicious behavior of the data center and data processor, this kind of approach is insufficient.

In the traditional centralized architecture of the IoT, problems such as data leakage, illegal tampering and information island have gradually become the shackles that restrict the wide expansion of the IoT.This paper proposes a new secure scheme of the private data based on consortium blockchain for the IoT, which allows users to achieve secure storage and data sharing of the private data. At the same time, after the IPFS system generates identification of the data and the secondary encryption by smart contract of the homomorphic encryption algorithm, it will greatly enhance the storage capacity and security for the private data. Security analysis shows that the scheme will further improve robustness of the network, reduce consumption of energy and protect the rights of users.

However, the prior mobile crowdsensing system mostly employs centralized architecture, which is subject to low reliability and is vulnerable to malicious attacks. Furthermore, it is difficult to guarantee the privacy with the transparency of MCS systems. These factors have been a major hindrance to the growth of MCS applications. Hence, it is imperative to ensure security and privacy of such systems in order to meet the wide spectrum of its applications. So we propose a decentralized blockchain crowdsensing system to harness the benefits of this sensing paradigm. Our objective is to develop a decentralized crowdsensing system and meet the security and privacy requirements without affecting data sensing quality, achieving a trade-off between data quality and privacy preserving. We plan to integrate blockchain technology into the crowdsensing system. Meanwhile, we also focus on how to protect data privacy in blockchains to develop an accountable MCS system.

In this paper, we propose a privacy protection scheme for multidimensional data aggregation and access control in the cloud Internet of Things for smart grid. The scalable access control based on attribute encryption is used to determine the data security of power user data in the process of data information sharing in the blockchain under the large data traffic of the cloud platform, which is to achieve privacy protection and fine-grained access control for demand-side multidimensional data. By using the EBGN homomorphic encryption algorithm, the multidimensional data is encrypted, and each dimension can be decrypted separately using the corresponding private key. The multidimensional data aggregation at the gateway can aggregate the multidimensional data into cipher-text, and the control center does not need to decrypt the cipher-text data of each dimension, thereby simplifying the operation of the gateway and the control center and improving the security and privacy of the data. By encrypting the EBGN private key of each dimension through the cipher-text policy attribute encryption algorithm, the fine-grained access control at the dimension level is realized. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the security of private data in the aspect of multidimensional data privacy protection, thus reducing the security risk of multidimensional data being illegally accessed.

Collecting data from multiple parties for analysis and mining will serve people better. However, it also brings unprecedented privacy threats to the participants. Therefore, safe and reliable data publishing among multiple data owners is an urgent problem to be solved. We mainly study the problem of privacy protection in data publishing. For a centralized scenario, we propose the LDA-DP algorithm. First, the within-class mean vectors and the pooled within-class scatter matrix are perturbed by the Gaussian noise. Second, the optimal projection direction vector with differential privacy is obtained by the Fisher criterion. Finally, the low-dimensional projection data of the original data are obtained. For distributed scenarios, we propose the Mul-LDA-DP algorithm based on a blockchain and differential privacy technology. First, the within-class mean vectors and within-class scatter matrices of local data are perturbed by the Gaussian noise and uploaded to the blockchain network. Second, the projection direction vector is calculated in the blockchain network and returned to the data owner. Finally, the data owner uses the projection direction vector to generate low-dimensional projection data of the original data and upload it to the blockchain network for publishing. Furthermore, in a distributed scenario, we propose a correlated noise generation scheme that uses the additivity of the Gaussian distribution to mitigate the effects of noise and can achieve the same noise level as the centralized scenario. We measure the utility of the published data by the SVM misclassification rate. We conduct comparative experiments with similar algorithms on different real data sets. The experimental results show that the data released by the two algorithms can maintain good utility in SVM classification.  © 2022 Zhen Gu et al.","","Data privacy; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Matrix algebra; Support vector machines; Vectors; Block-chain; Centralised; Class mean; Data publishing; Differential privacies; Direction vector; Mean vector; Projection direction; Within class; Within-class scatter matrix; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130954093"

Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control.

The private data onto specific IoT devices can be combined with intelligent platform to provide help for future research and prediction. As an important digital asset, individuals can sell private data to get rewards. Problems, such as privacy, security, and access control prevent individuals from sharing their private data. The blockchain technology is widely used to build an anonymous trading system. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure. Performance analysis and experimental results show that BPRPDS is efficient and practical.  © 2014 IEEE.","Anonymity; blockchain; data sharing; ring signature","Authentication; Blockchain; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; User profile; Anonymity; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Privacy preserving; Private data sharing; Ring signature.; Ring signatures; Security; Sharing schemes; Smart contract","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124206453"

It effectively collects and shares data from the surrounding environment to achieve better IoT services. For data sharing, the publish-subscribe (PS) paradigm provides a loosely coupled and scalable communication model. However, due to the loosely coupled nature, it is vulnerable to many attacks, resulting in some security threats to the IoT system, but it cannot provide the basic security mechanisms such as authentication and confidentiality to ensure the data security. Thus, in order to protect the system security and users' privacy, this paper presents a secure blockchain-based privacy-preserving access control scheme for the PS system, which adopt the fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to ensure the confidentiality of the publishing events and leverage the ledger to store the large volume of data events and access crossdomain information. Finally, we analyze the correctness and security of our scheme; moreover, we deploy our proposed prototype system on two computers and evaluate its performance. The experimental results show that our PS system can efficiently achieve the equilibrium between the system cost and the security requirement.  © 2022 Zhendong Liu et al.","","Access control; Blockchain; Data Sharing; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Data Sharing; Intelligent devices; Loosely coupled; Multi-domains; Privacy preserving; Publish subscribe Models; Publish/subscribe; Publish/Subscribe system; Surrounding environment; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141271645"

It is beneficial for remote-access transactions over telecommunication networks. Presently, this task is the most challenging one for researchers. People's mental status in the form of emotions is quite complex, and its complexity depends upon internal behavior. Emotion and facial behavior are essential characteristics through which human internal thought can be predicted. Speech is one of the mechanisms through which human's various internal reflections can be expected and extracted by focusing on the vocal track, the flow of voice, voice frequency, etc. Human voice specimens of different ages can be emotions that can be predicted through a deep learning approach using feature removal behavior prediction that will help build a step intelligent healthcare system strong and provide data to various doctors of medical institutes and hospitals to understand the physiological behavior of humans. Healthcare is a clinical area with data concentrated where many details are accessed, generated, and circulated periodically. Healthcare systems with many existing approaches like tracing and tracking continuously disclose the system's constraints in controlling patient data privacy and security. In the healthcare system, majority of the work involves swapping or using decisively confidential and personal data. A key issue is the modeling of approaches that guarantee the value of health-related data while protecting privacy and observing high behavioral standards. This will encourage large-scale perception, especially as healthcare information collection is expected to continue far off this current ongoing pandemic. So, the research section is looking for a privacy-preserving, secure, and sustainable system by using a technology called Blockchain. Data related to healthcare and distribution among institutions is a very challenging task. Storage of facts in the centralized form is a targeted choice for cyber hackers and initiates an accordant sight of patients' facts which will cause a problem in sharing information over a network. So, this research paper's approach based on Blockchain for sharing sufferer data in a secured manner is presented. Finally, the proposed model for extracting optimum value in error rate and accuracy was analyzed using different feature removal approaches to determine which feature removal performs better with different voice specimen variations. The proposed method increases the rate of correct evidence collection and minimizes the loss and authentication issues and using feature extraction based on text validation increases the sustainability of the healthcare system.  © 2022 Shrikant Upadhyay et al.","","Blockchain; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Security; Confidentiality; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Privacy; Blockchain; Complex networks; Data mining; Deep learning; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Health care; Hospital data processing; Network security; Physiology; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Speech recognition; Behavioral features; Block-chain; Essential characteristic; Facial behaviours; Features extraction; Healthcare systems; Physiological features; Remote access; Speaker verification; Telecommunications networks; accuracy; Article; blockchain; data extraction; data privacy; feature extraction; health care; health care system; human; information security; signal processing; simulation; computer network; computer security; confidentiality; health care delivery; privacy; Personal computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135500426"

The cutting edge in genomics: It was once a dream that genomics would improve human health in the future, and now it has become a scientific and financial reality with the aid of blockchain technology. Also, companies are developing DNA tests that can reveal information about our health and past. Blockchain is an ideal fit for this burgeoning industry because it can securely store billions of genetic data.

To improve the efficiency of machine learning, people realize efficient data classification by supporting the ML model, namely, the support vector machine (SVM) model, which is used in the realization of linear classification. However, data security and data protection are not addressed in SVM classifier training from multiple entity-labeled IoT data. In the existing solution, they depend on the implicit hypothesis that learning data can be dependable collected from complex data providers, which is often not the reality. To solve the question between the above problems, in this article, we put forward a secure support vector machine - a secure SECURE SVM training scheme for protecting the privacy on encrypted IoT data based on blockchain. Firstly, a secure and dependable data encryption sharing platform is established among complex data providers by using blockchain technology, which is recorded in a distributed ledger. Secondly, the homomorphic cryptosystem is used to design secure components, and the secure polynomial multiplication is improved to design a secure SVM training algorithm, which only needs two interactions in one iteration and does not need a trusted third party.

Maintaining the value stability of RMB payment means and the security and efficiency of RMB settlement system are the key measures to promote the internationalization of RMB. Aiming at the problem of data insecurity and untrustworthiness in traditional information systems, this paper proposes a data protection technology for information systems based on blockchain. In the hierarchical authority information system, multichain structure is adopted to divide the authority of nodes in each layer, so that only the nodes with corresponding authority can access and operate data. Private digital currency, which is based on blockchain technology and represented by payment token and stable currency, helps to improve the defects of the agent banking model but increases additional market risks and trust risks. Blockchain technology adopts special networking technology and consensus mechanism. Therefore, in blockchain privacy protection, the focus of blockchain privacy protection is identity information and transaction information.  © 2022 Yang Yi.","","Data privacy; Information systems; Information use; Internet of things; Block-chain; Business models; Internationalisation; Internet of things technologies; Personal privacy; Privacy protection; Production modes; Technology industry; Technology-based; Traditional industry; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138392181"

Existing solutions usually require the cooperation of trusted institutions, which is not practical. Blockchain adopts the PBFT consensus algorithm and does not require a trusted third party. Edge computing can greatly improve the efficiency of data aggregation and save data transmission time. Hence, this paper proposes a data collection scheme with a faulttolerant property based on blockchain and edge computing to protect sensitive information in smart agriculture. It is proved to be data security, privacy protection, and fault tolerance with the performance simulation and security analysis.  © 2022 SPIE.","blockchain; edge computing; PBFT; smart agriculture","Agricultural technology; Blockchain; Data acquisition; Decision making; Fault tolerance; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Agricultural productions; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Data collection scheme; Edge computing; PBFT; Plantings; Privacy preserving; Production models; Smart agricultures; Edge computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140968331"

The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as (Formula presented.) -anonymity, (Formula presented.) -diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model. The findings indicate that the proposed model delivers 85% more accurate privacy than the benchmark model. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","blockchain; federated learning; local differential privacy; privacy protection","Hash functions; Hospital data processing; Learning systems; Peer to peer networks; Privacy-preserving techniques; Semantics; Background knowledge; Benchmark models; Block-chain; Differential privacies; Federated learning; Filesystem; Local differential privacy; Medical information; Patient data; Privacy protection; Blockchain","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136894604"

Although Privacy-Preserving Computing achieves privacy protection for input data in the process of multi-party collaborative computing. However, the original data, computing process, and results face verification problems. As a result, sharing data on the blockchain will leak private information. To ensure the security of personal privacy information and recording in monitoring systems, This paper studies the use of homomorphic encryption for the secure transfer of blockchain data. Using our solution, the problem of data leakage in data sharing can be addressed by assuming that the data cannot be tampered with.

With the increase in industrial equipment (e.g., smart mobile terminals, sensors, and other embedded devices) in the Internet of Things and the advent of Industry 4.0, there has been an explosion of data generated that is characterized by a high volume but small size. How to manage and protect sensitive private data in data sharing has become an urgent issue for enterprises. Traditional data sharing and storage relies on trusted third-party platforms or distributed cloud storage, but these approaches run the risk of single-node failure, and third parties and cloud storage providers can be vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data theft. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain-based secure data transfer scheme for enterprises in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). We store raw data in the IIoT in the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) network after encryption and store the Keyword-index table we designed in Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, and enterprises share the data by querying the Keyword-index table. We use Fabric’s channel mechanism combined with our designed Chaincode to achieve privacy protection and efficient data transmission while using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to ensure data integrity. Finally, we performed security analysis and experiments on the proposed scheme, and the results show that overall the data transfer performance in the IPFS network is generally better than the traditional network, In the case of transferring 5 MB file size data, the transmission speed and latency of IPFS are 19.23 mb/s and 0.26 s, respectively, and the IPFS network is almost 4 times faster than the TCP/IP network while taking only a quarter of the time, which is more advantageous when transferring small files, such as data in the IIOT.

However, the current Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are scattered and easily tampered with, which is not conducive to the sharing of EMRs and is not compatible with thin clients. Fortunately, blockchain technology is tamper-proof, decentralized, auditable, and meets the above requirements. To solve these problems, we first propose Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing on Thin-Client for Electronic Medical Records (BPDST) approach that combines the k-anonymity and cloud storage, which thin clients can run like a full-node user and safeguard user's EMRs privacy concurrently. Using this approach, patients can control their own EMRs, while the consortium blockchain is responsible for the transaction process and sending the correct results to the patients. BPDST can also share information without leaking or tampering with EMRs' privacy, achieving the purpose of sharing medical data and privacy protection. In the medical field, this study can effectively protect users' privacy when sharing medical data to provide convenience for users and break the ""island"" phenomenon among various medical institutions.

In order to protect patients' privacy while achieving efficient medical data sharing, we propose a privacy-preserving medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. In the scheme, a conditional anonymous tracing mechanism is designed to protect users' privacy, in which malicious users can be tracked when illegal behavior occurs. However, as the number of users grows, masses of medical data might touch the storage bottleneck of blockchain. Therefore, an on-chain-off-chain storage model is designed to alleviate the storage burden of blockchain, in which only the metadata of EMRs are recorded in blockchain while the patients' EMRs are stored in cloud after being encrypted. In order to resist the collusion attack, an improved proxy re-encryption scheme is introduced to ensure that EMRs can only be accessed by the authorized data requester. Moreover, security analysis and simulation demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Medical computing; Network security; Privacy by design; Storage (materials); Collusion attack; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Medical fields; Privacy preserving; Proxy re-encryption schemes; Security analysis; Sharing schemes; Storage model; Data Sharing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101245600"

The digitization of medical equip-ment and the structuralization of electronic medical records are the general trends. While bringing convenience to people, the explosive growth of medical data will further promote the value of mining medical data. Obviously, finding out how to safely store such a large amount of data is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Additionally, the particularity of medical data makes it necessarily subject to great privacy protection needs. This reinforces the importance of designing a safe solution to ensure data privacy. Many existing schemes are based on single-server architecture, which have some natural defects (such as single-point faults). Although blockchain can help solve such problems, there are still some deficiencies in privacy protection.

Blockchain is a technology that provides such a data repository. However, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) assumed a centralized data repository, and it is commonly argued that blockchain technology is not usable. This paper aims to posit a framework for adopting a blockchain that follows the GDPR. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the Levy and Ellis’ narrative review of literature methodology, which is based on constructivist theory posited by Lincoln and Guba. Using five information systems and computer science databases, the researchers searched for studies using the keywords GDPR and blockchain, using a forward and backward search technique. The search identified a corpus of 416 candidate studies, from which the researchers applied pre-established criteria to select 39 studies. The researchers mined this corpus for concepts, which they clustered into themes. Using the accepted computer science practice of privacy by design, the researchers combined the clustered themes into the paper’s posited framework. Findings: The paper posits a framework that provides architectural tactics for designing a blockchain that follows GDPR to enhance privacy. The framework explicitly addresses the challenges of GDPR compliance using the unimagined decentralized storage of personal data. The framework addresses the blockchain–GDPR tension by establishing trust between a business and its customers vis-à-vis storing customers’ data. The trust is established through blockchain’s capability of providing the customer with private keys and control over their data, e.g. processing and access. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a framework that demonstrates that blockchain technology can be designed for use in GDPR compliant solutions. In using the framework, a blockchain-based solution provides the ability to audit and monitor privacy measures, demonstrates a legal justification for processing activities, incorporates a data privacy policy, provides a map for data processing and ensures security and privacy awareness among all actors. The research is limited to a focus on blockchain–GDPR compliance; however, future research is needed to investigate the use of the framework in specific domains. Practical implications: The paper posits a framework that identifies the strategies and tactics necessary for GDPR compliance. Practitioners need to compliment the framework with rigorous privacy risk management, i.e. conducting a privacy risk analysis, identifying strategies and tactics to address such risks and preparing a privacy impact assessment that enhances accountability and transparency of a blockchain. Originality/value: With the increasingly strategic use of data by businesses and the contravening growth of data privacy regulation, alternative technologies could provide businesses with a means to nurture trust with its customers regarding collected data. However, it is commonly assumed that the decentralized approach of blockchain technology cannot be applied to this business need. This paper posits a framework that enables a blockchain to be designed that follows the GDPR; thereby, providing an alternative for businesses to collect customers’ data while ensuring the customers’ trust. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; GDPR; Privacy","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096537200"

A large number of sensors and machinery are connected, and combined with the Internet, to achieve intelligent management and operation. However, the traditional centralized IoT data management solution inevitably encounters challenges of data trust, security, sustainability, and user privacy is difficult to guarantee. This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data. Finally, analysis and evaluation show that the proposed IoVChain scheme is feasible, safe, and extensible for the secure sharing of IoV data.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Blockchain; Internet of Things; privacy protection; trusted data sharing","Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Information management; Internet of things; Machinery; Network security; Sensor networks; Trees (mathematics); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Analysis and evaluation; Automatic registration; Data management solution; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Intelligent management; Intelligent transportation; Internet of thing (IOT); Privacy and security; Data Sharing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098758741"

However, reaching consensus in an online, digital world where identities are not tied to physical users is a challenging problem. Proof-of-work provides a solution by linking representation to a valuable, physical resource. While this has worked well, it uses a tremendous amount of specialized hardware and energy, with no utility beyond blockchain security. Here, the authors propose an alternative consensus scheme that directs the computational resources to the optimization of machine learning (ML) models – a task with more general utility. This is achieved by a hybrid consensus scheme relying on three parties: data providers, miners, and a committee. The data provider makes data available and provides payment in return for the best model, miners compete about the payment and access to the committee by producing ML optimized models, and the committee controls the ML competition.

Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier’s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants’ privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate’s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods. © 2020 by the authors.

The model also ensures a secure data aggregation process with low computational overhead. The proposed model is 80% more effective than the traditional approach in detecting smart meter manipulation, and the computation cost is 20% to 80% less than existing techniques. Thus, the proposed blockchain and homomorphic encryption-based data aggregation (BHDA) scheme shows a significant improvement in performance and privacy preservation with minimal computation overhead for data aggregation in smart grids. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Data aggregation; Homomorphic encryption; Privacy preservation; Smart grid","Blockchain; Data privacy; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Real time systems; Smart power grids; Aggregation model; Block-chain; Computation costs; Data aggregation; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Homomorphic-encryptions; Privacy concerns; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Smart grid; Cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107640686"

This solution brings together advances from the fields of identity management, confidential computing, and advanced data usage control. In the area of identity management, the solution is aligned with emerging decentralized identity standards: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID communication and verifiable credentials (VCs). In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual's data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals. Specifically, our design covers necessary roles in the data-sharing ecosystem: The issuer of personal data, the individual holder of the personal data (i.e., the data subject), a trusted data storage manager, a trusted license distributor, and the data consumer. The proof-of-concept implementation utilizes the decentralized identity framework being developed by the Hyperledger Indy/Aries project. A genomic data licensing use case is evaluated, which shows the feasibility and scalability of the solution. © Ekonomika 2021.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120777418"

Data sharing in consortium blockchain has provided a promising direction for efficient privacy preserving government data sharing. However, since government data is not owned by a single person or any government employers, it is hard to attribute participants’ responsibility for motivating data sharing behavior in blockchain systems. Furthermore, the scope and scale of government data to be shared among departments is unclear, as the purposes for retrieving shared data are dynamically changing. In order to solve these problems, we propose a Service-On-Chain (or simply, SOC) approach. The SOC approach can effectively identify different departments’ data retrieving requirements while efficiently sharing government data with trustworthiness in data content and controllability in data ownership. In particular, we utilize smart contracts to provide an onchain service to define data sharing agreements between government departments, which can identify ambiguous data retrieving requirements and formalize the process logic. We apply the SOC approach to a real world scenario and demonstrate that the SOC approach provides a feasible solution for secure and efficient sharing of data among government departments. © 2021","Consortium blockchain; Government data sharing; Privacy preserving; Smart contract","Data privacy; Data Sharing; Block-chain; Consortium blockchain; Data Sharing; Government data sharing; Government departments; Privacy breaches; Privacy preserving; Shared data; Smart contract; Social development; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110028674"

In order to ensure the protection of data privacy when sharing medical data, we propose a medical data privacy protection framework based on blockchain (MPBC). In this framework, we protect privacy by adding differential privacy noise into federated learning. In addition, the growing volume of medical data could make blockchain storage problematic. Therefore, a storage mode is proposed to reduce the storage burden of blockchain. The raw data are stored locally and only the hash value calculated by IPFS are stored in blockchain. To enhance the performance, a mechanism is used to validate transactions and aggregate the model.

It enables vehicles to exchange vehicular data (e.g., GPS, sensors, and brakes) with different entities nearby. However, sharing these vehicular data over the air raises concerns about identity privacy leakage. Besides, the centralized architecture adopted in existing IoV systems is fragile to single point of failure and malicious attacks. With the emergence of blockchain technology, it has the chance to solve these problems due to its features of tamper-proof, traceability and decentralization. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving vehicular data sharing framework based on blockchain. In particular, we design an anonymous and auditable data sharing scheme using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technol-ogy so as to protect the identity privacy of vehicles while preserving the vehicular data auditability for Trusted Authorities (TAs). In response to high mobility of vehicles, we design an efficient multi-sharding protocol to decrease blockchain communication costs without compromising the blockchain security. We implement a prototype of our framework and conduct extensive experiments and simulations on it.

Among the methods to solve the oracle problem, a method of configuring oracle based on TLS, an existing internet infrastructure, has been proposed. However, these methods currently have the disadvantage of not supporting privacy protection for external data, and there are limitations in configuring the process of a smart contract based on external data verification for automation. To solve this problem, we propose a framework consisting of middleware of external source server, data prover, and verification contract. The framework converts the data signed in the web server into a proof that the owner can prove with zk-SNARKs and provides a smart contract that can verify this. Through these procedures, data owners not only protect their privacy by proving themselves, but they can also automate on-chain processing through smart contract verification. For the proposed framework, we create a proof using libsnark for server data and show the performance and cost to verify with Solidity the smart contract language of the Ethereum platform. © 2020 by the authors.

The technical information about the instructions to the vehicle (devices), authentication, integrity, and vehicle reactions are stored in a cloud platform wherein Pentatope based Elliptic curve cryptography and SHA are used to ensure privacy in data storage. The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks.

Through constructing the structure of the protocol and carrying out formal proof calculations, it is confirmed that the protocol can be integrated into the blockchain network to merge different private messages for efficient signing under anonymity. In addition, by analyzing the nature and security of the protocol, it can be proved that the overhead about computation of the general-purpose privacy computing scheme using the BPLSM protocol on the blockchain is low, and it also has strong information imperceptibility. In the end, experimental simulation results show that the time cost of BPLSM protocol verification in a small-scale multi-party transaction with a fixed number of people is about 83.5% lower than that of the current mainstream BLS signature. © 2021, Science Press.

Recently, blockchain-based eHealth systems have achieved great success in terms of EMRs sharing and management, but there still remain some challenges. Permissioned blockchain-based solutions provide high throughput and scalability, but may suffer from rollback attacks and lead to privacy leakage. Designs based on the public blockchain, on the other hand, are more open and secure, but sacrifice scalability and have no incentives for medical institutions to join into the systems. Moreover, data retrieval in blockchain-based eHealth systems is inefficient because of the basic blockchain structure. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing and privacy-preserving eHealth system named SPChain. To achieve quick retrieval, we devise special keyblocks and microblocks for patients to store their EMRs. A reputation system is also constructed to motivate medical institutions to participate in SPChain. By using proxy re-encryption schemes, SPChain achieves medical data sharing for patients in a privacy-preserving manner. To evaluate SPChain, we leverage the distribution of miners in the real world to test the system's performance and ability to resist mentioned attacks. The results show that SPChain can achieve high throughput (220 TPS) with low storage overhead. Compared with the existing schemes, SPChain achieves lower time complexity in terms of data retrieving, and can resist proposed blockchain attacks as well as SPChain attacks. © 2021","Blockchain; Data sharing; Electronic medical record; Privacy; Reputation system","Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; eHealth; Medical computing; Scalability; Search engines; Block-chain; Data Sharing; e-Health systems; High-throughput; Medical data; Medical institutions; Medical record; Privacy; Privacy preserving; Reputation systems; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103768801"

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner's privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2021 ACM.","Behavior control; blockchain; Internet of Things; smart contract","Blockchain; Privacy by design; Behavior control; Device management; Distributed approaches; Internet of thing (IOT); Non-trivial tasks; Privacy preserving; Quality of life; Security and privacy; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101664692"

Attackers can use data mining algorithms to obtain and analyze users' private data, which will lead to the disclosure of transaction information. Simultaneously, it is also necessary for regulatory authorities to implement effective supervision of private data. Therefore, we propose a supervisable energy transaction data privacy protection scheme, which aims to trade off the supervision of energy transaction data by the supervisory authority and the privacy protection of transaction data. First, the concealment of the transaction amount is realized by Pedersen commitment and Bulletproof range proof. Next, the combination of ElGamal encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology ensures the authenticity of audit tickets, which allows regulators to achieve reliable supervision of the transaction privacy data without opening the commitment. Finally, the multibase decomposition method is used to improve the decryption efficiency of the supervisor.

As genomic data contain various privacy-sensitive information, security schemes that protect confidentiality and control access are essential. Many security techniques have been proposed to safeguard healthcare data. However, these techniques are inadequate for genomic data management because of their large size. Additionally, privacy problems due to the sharing of gene data are yet to be addressed. In this study, we propose a secure genomic data management system using blockchain and local differential privacy (LDP). The proposed system employs two types of storage: private storage for internal staff and semi-private storage for external users. In private storage, because encrypted gene data are stored, only internal employees can access the data. Meanwhile, in semi-private storage, gene data are irreversibly modified by LDP. Through LDP, different noises are added to each section of the genomic data. Therefore, even though the third party uses or exposes the shared data, the owner’s privacy is guaranteed. Furthermore, the access control for each storage is ensured by the blockchain, and the gene owner can trace the usage and sharing status using a decentralized application in a mobile device. © 2021 by the authors.

Sharing health data is considered a key way to improve the quality of health care services and reduce the cost of health care. However, nowadays, many people will create electronic health records in different hospitals. In the process of cross-hospital diagnosis, due to the decentralized storage of electronic medical record in various hospitals, the electronic health records cannot be shared. This phenomenon will cause obstacles to doctors' diagnosis, impede data sharing and endanger patient privacy. To solve these problems, we propose an EHRs privacy protection data sharing scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, the original EHRs are securely stored in the cloud. The generated index is stored on the hospital private blockchain. Visitors can obtain the index of electronic health records through the blockchain. It's convenient to view the patient's electronical health records and diagnose the patient's condition in detail. In this way, the risk of medical data leakage can be greatly reduced. The advantages in the blockchain ensure that EHRs cannot be arbitrarily modified. Meanwhile, the original data is stored in the cloud, while the blockchain only stores indexes, which solves the problem of limited storage space in the blockchain. According to the current medical situation, we put forward Wanchain as a service (WaaS), and propose a cross-blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for electronic health records. Wanchain is used to achieve cross-blockchain secure access to EHRs data when patients visit different hospitals. In addition, our scheme ensures that patients can delete EHRs data effectively and freely. The safety and effectiveness of the system are proved through security analysis and performance evaluation. © 2021 IEEE.","cross-blockchain; electronic health records; privacy-preserving; WaaS","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Blockchain; Cloud computing; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Electronic document exchange; Health care; Hospitals; Medical computing; Privacy by design; Records management; Electronic health record; Electronic health record (EHRs); Electronic medical record; Patient privacies; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Quality of health care; Security analysis; Data Sharing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107645373"

In the battle against the outbreak of COVID-19, how to manage and share the COVID-19 Electric Medical Records (CEMRs) safely and effectively in the world, prevent malicious users from tampering with CEMRs, and protect the privacy of patients are very worthy of attention. In particular, the semi-trusted medical cloud platform has become the primary means of hospital medical data management and information services. Security and privacy issues in the medical cloud platform are more prominent and should be addressed with priority. To address these issues, on the basis of ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption, we propose a blockchain-empowered security and privacy protection scheme with traceable and direct revocation for COVID-19 medical records. In this scheme, we perform the blockchain for uniform identity authentication and all public keys, revocation lists, etc are stored on a blockchain. The system manager server is responsible for generating the system parameters and publishes the private keys for the COVID-19 medical practitioners and users. The cloud service provider (CSP) stores the CEMRs and generates the intermediate decryption parameters using policy matching. The user can calculate the decryption key if the user has private keys and intermediate decrypt parameters. Only when attributes are satisfied access policy and the user's identity is out of the revocation list, the user can get the intermediate parameters by CSP. The malicious users may track according to the tracking list and can be directly revoked. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is indicated to be safe under the Decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption and can resist many attacks. The simulation experiment demonstrates that the communication and storage overhead is less than other schemes in the public-private key generation, CEMRs encryption, and decryption stages. Besides, we also verify that the proposed scheme works well in the blockchain in terms of both throughput and delay.  © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic medical records.; security and privacy protection; traceable and revocation","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Information management; Information services; Privacy by design; Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryptions; Global public health; Medical data management; Privacy preserving; Security analysis; Security and privacy issues; Security and privacy protection; Storage overhead; Data Sharing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112670673"

As compared to public blockchain and private blockchain, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases due to its privacy-preserving ability, auditability and high transaction rate. However, the present co-audit of privacy-preserving data on consortium blockchain is inefficient. Private data is usually encrypted by a session key before being published on a consortium blockchain for privacy preservation. The session key is shared with transaction parties and auditors for their access. For decentralizing auditorial power, multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain jointly undertake the responsibility of auditing. The distribution of the session key to an auditor requires individually encrypting the session key with the public key of the auditor. The transaction initiator needs to be online when each auditor asks for the session key, and one encryption of the session key for each auditor consumes resources. This work proposes GAChain and applies group key agreement technology to efficiently co-audit privacy-preserving data on consortium blockchain. Multiple auditors on the consortium blockchain form a group and utilize the blockchain to generate a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys. The session key is encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain together with the encrypted private data. Auditors then obtain the encrypted session key from the chain and decrypt it with their respective group decryption key for co-auditing. The group key generation is involved only when the group forms or group membership changes, which happens very infrequently on the consortium blockchain. We implement the prototype of GAChain based on Hyperledger Fabric framework. Our experimental studies demonstrate that GAChain improves the co-audit efficiency of transactions containing private data on Fabric, and its incurred overhead is moderate.  © 2021 IEEE.","co-audit; Consortium blockchain; group key agreement; privacy preservation","Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Privacy-preserving techniques; Block-chain; Co-audit; Consortium blockchain; Decryption keys; Encryption key; Group key agreement; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Private data; Session key; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128761178"

Due to recent laws and regulations (e.g, General Data Protection Regulation), PPRL approaches are increasingly demanded in real-world application areas such as health-care, credit analysis, public policy evaluation, and national security. However, the majority of the PPRL approaches consider an unrealistic adversary model, particularly the Honest but Curious (HBC) model, which assumes that all PPRL parties will follow a pre-agreed data integration protocol, and will not try to break the confidentiality of the data handled during the process. The HBC model is hard to employ in real-world applications, mainly because of the need to trust other parties fully. To overcome the limitations associated with the majority of the adversary models considered by PPRL approaches, we propose a protocol that considers covert adversaries, i.e., adversaries that may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat. In such protocol, however, the honest parties are able to detect this misbehavior with a high probability. To provide a proof-of-concept implementation of this protocol, we employ the Blockchain technology and propose an improvement in the most used anonymization technique for PPRL, the Bloom Filter. The evaluation carried out using several real-world data sources has demonstrated the effectiveness (linkage quality) obtained by our contributions, as well as the ability to detect the misbehavior of a malicious adversary during the PPRL execution. © 2021","Blockchain; Bloom Filter; Data privacy; Entity resolution; Privacy preserving entity resolution","Blockchain; National security; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Privacy by design; Quality control; Adversary modeling; General data protection regulations; High probability; Laws and regulations; Malicious adversaries; Policy evaluation; Privacy preserving record linkages; Protocol specifications; Data integration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108270526"

K-anonymity is one of the most popular privacy protection solutions, in which the real location of the request vehicle (RV) can be covered by a cloaking area including the location of k-1 cooperative vehicles (CVs). However, K-anonymity assumes all CVs are always honest and thus offering opportunities for dishonest CVs to provide false location information. To combat such threats, we propose a trusted cloaking area construction (TCAC) scheme based on the trust mechanism to protect the location privacy of vehicles. In this article, the trust value is not only used to identify dishonest CVs, but also utilized to decide the LBS request of RV. A low trust value will make the LBS request be rejected due to dishonest and selfish cooperative behaviors when the RV has played the role of CV. To deal with the massive trust requirements caused by frequent vehicle movement, edge computing is employed to assist trust value evaluation. Moreover, traditional central and distributed trust data management may be unsuitable for vehicular networks. We also propose a blockchain-based trust data management method by combining vehicular regions partition, so as to rapidly evaluate trust value during the cloaking area construction. The security analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest CVs, inspire selfish CVs, and protect the location privacy of vehicles effectively, whereas the required computation time and communication cost are both limited. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; edge computing; privacy protection; trust; vehicular networks","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Information management; Location; Military vehicles; Privacy by design; Telecommunication services; Co-operative behaviors; Communication cost; Cooperative vehicles; Location information; Location privacy protection; Privacy protection; Vehicle movements; Vehicular networks; Location based services","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098792730"

However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT data aggregation process is a non-trivial task. Generally, the IoT data aggregation process is based on centralized servers. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to coordinate several untrustworthy parties. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization while overcoming the trust problem. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT data aggregation may become a reasonable choice for the design of a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose PrivDA, a Privacy-preserving IoT Data Aggregation scheme based on the blockchain and homomorphic encryption technologies. In the proposed system, each data consumer can create a smart contract and publish both terms of service and requested IoT data. Thus, the smart contract puts together into one group potential data producers that can answer the consumer’s request and chooses one aggregator, the role of which is to compute the group requested result using homomorphic computations. Therefore, group-level aggregation obfuscates IoT data, which complicates sensitive information inference from a single IoT device. Finally, we deploy the proposal on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.

And meanwhile, it achieves the data availability and consistency between patients and research institutions, where zero-knowledge proof is employed to verify whether the patient's medical data meets the specific requirements proposed by research institutions without revealing patients’ privacy, and then the proxy re-encryption technology is adopted to ensure that research institutions can decrypt the intermediary ciphertext.

This paper has been intended to study and surveyed how to preserve and secure health care data against suspicious attacks. The high demand for efficient storage leads to Blockchain as storage. The dominant Blockchain storage stored a large amount of health data with a shared key to encrypt the data to access it. The privacy-preserving platform technique has been implemented to curb the unauthorized users and accomplish privacy and security. Elliptic curve cryptography used for encryption purpose to encrypt the sensitive data while sharing the health data.

Hence, clients' data in a single bank may be partial and incomplete. If the data can be combined, each bank obtains comprehensive information, so as to better carry out business and enhance the quality of service, such as recommending financial products and inquiring about personal credit records. However, after the promulgation of GDPR by European Union in 2018, it is illegal to directly consolidate data crossing enterprises due to privacy and security concerns, especially for privacy-sensitive industries. Emerging federated learning(FL) is very suitable for secure data sharing for distributed banks in privacy. To prevent from connection of clients' data and the certain bank, we adopt anonymity mechanism to hide the real identity of banks. In this paper, we first propose blockchain-empowered secure federated learning for distributed banks based on multi-party computation(MPC) with multi-key fully-homomorphic encryption(FHE) scheme. Then, we give detailed description of multi-key FHE based MPC protocol, anonymity mechanism and permissioned blockchain consensus protocol.

In this environment, surrounded by technologies, data, and personal information, have become an essential and coveted tool for many sectors. In this scenario, where a large amount of data has been collected, stored, and shared, privacy concerns arise, especially when dealing with sensitive data such as health data. The information owner generally has no control over his information, which can bring serious consequences such as increases in health insurance prices or put the individual in an uncomfortable situation with disclosing his physical or mental health. While privacy regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), make it clear that the information owner must have full control and management over their data, disparities have been observed in most systems and platforms. Therefore, they are often not able to give consent or have control and management over their data. For the users to exercise their right to privacy and have sufficient control over their data, they must know everything that happens to them, where their data is, and where they have been. It is necessary that the entire life cycle, from generation to deletion of data, is managed by its owner. To this end, this article presents an Information Chain of Custody Model based on Blockchain technology, which allows from the traceability of information to the offer of tools that will enable the effective management of data, offering total control to its owner. The result showed that the prototype was very useful in the traceability of the information.

At the same time, it becomes a great concern that how to obtain optimal outputs from big data publishing and sharing management while protecting privacy. Many researchers seek to realize differential privacy protection in massive high-dimensional datasets using the method of principal component analysis. However, these algorithms are inefficient in processing and do not take into account the different privacy protection needs of each attribute in high-dimensional datasets. To address the above problem, we design a Divided-block Sparse Matrix Transformation Differential Privacy Data Publishing Algorithm (DSMT-DP). In this algorithm, different levels of privacy budget parameters are assigned to different attributes according to the required privacy protection level of each attribute, taking into account the privacy protection needs of different levels of attributes. Meanwhile, the use of the divided-block scheme and the sparse matrix transformation scheme can improve the computational efficiency of the principal component analysis method for handling large amounts of high-dimensional sensitive data, and we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm satisfies differential privacy. Our experimental results show that the mean square error of the proposed algorithm is smaller than the traditional differential privacy algorithm with the same privacy parameters, and the computational efficiency can be improved. Further, we combine this algorithm with blockchain and propose an Efficient Privacy Data Publishing and Sharing Model based on the blockchain. Publishing and sharing private data on this model not only resist strong background knowledge attacks from adversaries outside the system but also prevent stealing and tampering of data by not-completely-honest participants inside the system.  © 2021 Yiyang Hong et al.","","Blockchain; Data privacy; Efficiency; Large dataset; Linear transformations; Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Metadata; Parameter estimation; Principal component analysis; Block sparse; Block-chain; Data publishing; Data Sharing; Differential privacies; High-dimensional dataset; Matrix transformation; Principal-component analysis; Privacy protection; Sparse matrices; Computational efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122259631"

This paper suggests a method to implement a reliable clarification to these points. Traditionally sophisticated methods trading with the security of health records ordinarily makes information inaccessible system to patients. Certain methods struggle to adjust information reliability, patient desire, and regular communication with supplier information. Blockchain(BC) resolves the preceding difficulties from it shares data in a decentralized and transactional way. The utilize of BC could support the healthcare division to adjust the accessibility, privacy, and security of PHRs. This document suggests a BC framework to efficiently and securely collect and keep health records. It represents a reliable and skilled means of achieving healthcare data for patients, physicians, and security insurance agencies while defending the patients of information.

Data aggregation is one of the key technologies in wireless sensor networks, which reduces the amount of data transmission between nodes by merging similar data and simplifying redundant data, thus significantly reducing the computation cost and communication overhead of the system. Many data aggregation schemes have been developed for the smart grid in the past years. However, most of the data aggregation schemes ignore the data security and privacy protection issues of the edge layer. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose an edge blockchain assisted lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation for smart grid, named EBDA. In this work, we integrate edge computing and blockchain to design a three-layer architecture data aggregation scheme for smart grid. This new architecture supports a two-level data aggregation scheme, which is more efficient and secure. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, EBDA shows great superiority in terms of resisting network attacks, reducing system computation costs and communication overhead compared with existing schemes.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; data aggregation; Edge computing; smart grid","Blockchain; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric power transmission networks; Network architecture; Privacy by design; Sensor nodes; Analysis and simulation; Communication overheads; Computation costs; Data security and privacy; Privacy preserving; Reducing systems; Threelayer architecture; Traditional power system; Smart power grids","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099080580"

Blockchain is a point-to-point distributed ledger technology based on cryptographic algorithms. The characteristics of decentralization, tamper resistance, anonymity, and public verifiability can alleviate data security issues in IoT.

However, the poor implementation of access control of educational data produced by the IoT devices has brought students' and teachers' privacy into danger. Attackers can access educational data that they are not permitted to access and even erase the records during access. To tackle this problem, we employ blockchain technology to guarantee the integrity of access control rules and trace the records of access events. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme for the data produced by IoT devices. The scheme consists of three components: (1) a well-implemented data collection module that is deployed in smart classrooms, which collects and uploads data about the real-time situation inside the smart classroom to the data center; (2) a MongoDB-based data center and its control module that makes access control decisions based on the verification of the permissions of visitors, where the permissions are managed by blockchain; and (3) a customized blockchain system that stores and keeps security policy updates of the role-based access control module and records access events in a trusted way. Our analysis indicates that the proposed access control scheme guarantees the correctness of the access control process and makes the access of collected educational data auditable and responsible. Our system collectively analyzes the context of the smart classroom and is capable of detecting multiple scenarios such as absence, lateness, and gunshot.

However, the selection of the most effective providers remains challenging. To tackle these problems, we propose a dynamic-game-with-complete-information-and-Blockchain-based Crowdsourcing data Trading system (CBCT), which mainly includes a smart contracts called CBCToken. Firstly, we replace the data trading broker and adopt the Stackelberg Game, a Dynamic Game with complete information (DGC), to manage the selection of providers.

By integrating with blockchain technology, we could extend the model's capabilities by presenting transparency in logic execution and integrity in data storage. Despite these advantages, blockchain brings in new challenges regarding system performance and data privacy. Due to distributed nature of blockchain, any new updating request needs to be reflected in all network's peers before proceeding to the subsequence requests. This process produces delay and possibility in request rejection due to update conflict. In addition, data removal is no longer feasible since each record is protected by immutable hashed link. To overcome these limitations, the integration model of blockchain and message queue is proposed in this paper. The design addresses security concerns in data exchanging patterns, voter anonymization, and proof of system actor's legitimacy. Performance tests are conducted on system prototypes which were deployed on two different settings. The result shows that the system can perform well in production environment, and introduction of message queue handling scheme can cope with blockchain's errors in unexpected scenarios.  © 2021 Siriboon Chaisawat and Chalee Vorakulpipat.","","Data privacy; Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Queueing theory; Block-chain; Data storage; E-Voting; Integration models; Message queues; Personal privacy; Privacy protection; Request rejections; Systems performance; Voting model; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117359379"

In the Internet era, privacy is strongly linked to data protection. “Data Protection” as such is nowhere defined; yet it can be understood as the protection of personal information from over exploitation. The right to the protection of personal data has not yet been treated as a fundamental right in some jurisdictions. In the European Union, data protection enjoyed protection as a fundamental right. The General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter the Regulation) inspired the people to claim legal protection of personal data. In the present digital world, data can represent a natural person. Blockchain’s emergence, on the other hand, is being the epitome of the technological advancement of the 20th century. Indeed, initially has been focused on digital currency and financial world, its real applicability is much more diverse and yet to be explored fully. In the internet world value of human life is somehow superseded by persons’ own information, called data, in digital society. Political superiors try to pull up the balance of interest towards their governs, however, tech-moguls to be competitive and ace in free digital service need excessive data. Blockchain has both pros and cons to be applied as a technical platform in data driven business. Few of its characteristics are best suited with some data processing principles but few are detrimental to the data subject and the enforcer at the same time.

Similarly, blockchain uses the same approach by providing a digital ledger that can cover the flaws in the centralised system. Motivated by the merits of a decentralised approach, we construct a collaborative model of simultaneous distributed learning by employing multiple computing devices over shared memory with blockchain smart contracts as a secure incentive mechanism. The collaborative model preserves a value-driven of distributed learning in enhancing users’ privacy. It is supported by blockchain with a secure decentralised incentive technique without having a single point of failure. Furthermore, potential vulnerabilities and plausible defences are also outlined. The experimental results positively recommend that the collaborative model satisfies the design goals.

Health data are usually collected from edge-based Internet of medical things (IoMT) with devices such as smart wearable devices, smart watches, and smartphones. Since health data are highly private and have great financial value, adversaries ceaselessly launch diverse attacks to obtain private information. All these issues pose great challenges to health data sharing in edge-based IoMT scenarios. Existing research either lacks comprehensive consideration of privacy and security protection or fails to provide a proper incentive mechanism, which expels users from sharing data. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-assisted data sharing scheme, which allows secure and privacy-preserving profile matching. A bloom filter with hash functions is designed to verify the authenticity of keyword ciphertext. Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithm and smart contracts are employed to achieve secure profile matching. To incentivize users actively participating in profile matching, we devise an incentive mechanism and construct a two-phase Stackelberg game to address pricing problems for data owners and accessing problems of data requesters. The optimal pricing mechanism is specially designed for encouraging more users to participate in health data sharing and maximizing users’ profit. Moreover, security analysis illustrates that the proposed protocol is capable of satisfying various security goals, while performance evaluation shows high scalability and feasibility of the proposed scheme in edge-based IoMT scenarios.

Existing smart healthcare systems facilitate the patient to reserve a particular time slot and attain real-time healthcare information. However, most of these systems need sensitive information about patients, i.e., desired destination of the healthcare providers. Moreover, existing systems utilize a centralized system which makes these systems vulnerable to numerous intruders’ attacks and security breaches (particularly related to service providers) and results in single-point failure of the entire system.

After the gateway verifies the HMAC code of the sensor data, it encrypts the sensor data, constructs a blockchain transaction and submits it to the blockchain node. Blockchain nodes cache transactions and periodically generate blocks to confirm that the transactions are on the chain. After the gateway constructs an authorised transaction and submits it to the blockchain node for confirmation, the designated decentralised application (DApp) obtains the permission and related keys to access the designated sensor managed by the gateway. Finally, the DApp queries the local blockchain node for the specified sensor data and decrypts the results. Experiments have proven through in-depth discussions on sensor synthesis data, sensor/gateway verification, transaction data encryption and transaction signatures that the scheme can be used in IoT systems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Authentication; Blockchain; Cryptography; Privacy by design; Data privacy protections; Decentralised; Hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC); Sampled data; Third parties; Transaction data; Transaction signatures; User identity; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107198217"

To ensure the safe sharing of resources in IIoT, this paper proposes a data security sharing model based on privacy protection (DSS-PP) for blockchain-enabled IIoT. Compared with previous works, DSS-PP has obvious advantages in several important aspects: (1) In the process of identity authentication, it protects users' personal information by using authentication technology with hidden attributes; (2) the encrypted shared resources are stored in off-chain database of the blockchain, while only the ciphertext index information is stored in the block. It reduces the storage load of the blockchain; (3) it uses blockchain logging technology to trace and account for illegal access. Under the hardness assumption of Inverse Computational Diffe–Hellman (ICDH) problem, this model is proven to be correct and safe. Through the analysis of performance, DSS-PP has better performance than the referred works. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","blockchain; data sharing; IIoT; information security; privacy protection","Authentication; Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Inverse problems; Authentication technology; Identity authentication; Index information; Model-based OPC; Personal information; Privacy protection; Security threats; Shared resources; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092202572"

This paper is concerned with data privacy-preserving distributed knowledge discovery which gives penalty to the party who quits the cooperation in the discovery process. It proposes a blockchain-based distributed machine learning method which does not disclose the participating parties’ data and gives the penalty to betraying parties. The proposed method makes the participating parties communicate with each other via the smart contract on the blockchain network.

Meanwhile, the health-related mobile apps and devices also generate a large amount of medical data, which is critical for promoting disease research and diagnosis. However, medical data is too sensitive to share, which is also a common issue for IoT (Internet of Things) data. The traditional centralized cloud-based medical data sharing schemes have to rely on a single trusted third party. Therefore, the schemes suffer from single-point failure and lack of privacy protection and access control for the data. Blockchain is an emerging technique to provide an approach for managing data in a decentralized manner. Especially, the blockchain-based smart contract technique enables the programmability for participants to access the data. All the interactions are authenticated and recorded by the other participants of the blockchain network, which is tamper resistant. In this paper, we leverage the K-anonymity and searchable encryption techniques and propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme for medical data sharing among medical institutions and data users. To be specific, the consortium blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, is adopted to allow data users to search for encrypted medical data records. The smart contract, i.e., the chaincode, implements the attribute-based access control mechanisms to guarantee that the data can only be accessed by the user with proper attributes. The K-anonymity and searchable encryption ensure that the medical data is shared without privacy leaking, i.e., figuring out an individual patient from queries. We implement a prototype system using the chaincode of Hyperledger Fabric. From the functional perspective, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies security goals and precedes others. From the performance perspective, we conduct experiments by simulating different numbers of medical institutions. The experimental results demonstrate that the scalability and performance of our scheme are practical. © 2021 Yingwen Chen et al.","","5G mobile communication systems; Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Internet of things; Patient treatment; Privacy by design; Remote patient monitoring; Attribute based access control; Medical institutions; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Scalability and performance; Searchable encryptions; Single point failure; Trusted third parties; Data Sharing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109980936"

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; Data storage; Distributed ledger technology; Health informatics; Healthcare; Privacy; Secure computation","Blockchain; Digital storage; Health care; Privacy by design; Research and development management; Systems analysis; Distributed software architecture; Healthcare industry; Information management systems; Information processing and management; Legal requirements; Privacy preserving; Reference models; Research and development; Information management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100242135"

However, a large amount of IoT data is sensitive, and the leakage of such data is a privacy breach. The security of sensitive IoT data is a big issue, as the data is shared over an insecure network channel. Current solutions include symmetric encryption and access controls to secure the data transfer, but they have some drawbacks such as a single point of failure. Blockchain is a promising distributed ledger technology that can prevent the malicious tampering of data, offering reliable data storage. This paper proposes a distributed access control system based on blockchain technology to secure IoT data. The proposed mechanism is based on fog computing and the concept of the alliance chain. This method uses mixed linear and nonlinear spatiotemporal chaotic systems (MLNCML) and the least significant bit (LSB) to encrypt the IoT data on an edge node and then upload the encrypted data to the cloud. The proposed mechanism can solve the problem of a single point of failure of access control by providing the dynamic and fine-grained access control for IoT data. The experimental results of this method demonstrated that it can protect the privacy of IoT data efficiently. © 2020, The Author(s).","Access control; Blockchain; Cloud storage; Data privacy; IoT","Access control; Blockchain; Chaotic systems; Cryptography; Data privacy; Data transfer; Digital storage; Fog computing; Network security; Distributed access controls; Insecure networks; Internet of thing (IOT); Least significant bits; Privacy breaches; Privacy protection; Spatiotemporal chaotic systems; Symmetric encryption; Internet of things","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092670092"

Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud‐data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large‐data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non‐linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non‐ polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real‐time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time. © 2021 by the authors.

IIoT data uploaded to the cloud contain personal and sensitive information; thus, there is a growing concern about data privacy. Current existing data analysis solutions, however, assume that the data are reliably and securely collected from different IIoT data providers, an assumption that is not always true in the real world. To address the issues, in this article we propose a privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition based on gradient descent over blockchain-based encrypted IIoT data. Specifically, we use blockchain techniques to enable IIoT data providers to reliably and securely share their data by encrypting them locally before recording them in the blockchain. We use tensor train (TT) theory to build an efficient TT-based tucker decomposition based on gradient descent that tremendously reduces the number of elements to be updated during the tucker decomposition. We utilize the massive resources of fogs and clouds to implement an efficient privacy-preserving tucker train decomposition scheme. We use homomorphic encryption to build our scheme that does complete tucker train decomposition without the involvement of users.

However, if data is stored, supervised, and distributed on a multiparty equal blockchain, it will face major security risks, such as data privacy leakage, unauthorized access, and trust issues. How to protect the privacy of shared data has become a key factor restricting the implementation of this technology. We propose a secure and trusted agricultural product traceability system (BCST-APTS), which is supported by blockchain and CP-ABE encryption technology. It can set access control policies through data attributes and encrypt data on the blockchain. This can not only ensure the confidentiality of the data stored in the blockchain, but also set flexible access control policies for the data. In addition, a whole-chain attribute management infrastructure has been constructed, which can provide personalized attribute encryption services. Furthermore, a reencryption scheme based on ciphertext-policy attribute encryption (RE-CP-ABE) is proposed, which can meet the needs of efficient supervision and sharing of ciphertext data. Finally, the system architecture of the BCST-APTS is designed to successfully solve the problems of mutual trust, privacy protection, fine-grained, and personalized access control between all parties.  © 2022 Guofeng Zhang et al.","","Access control; Agricultural products; Cryptography; Data privacy; Access control policies; Block-chain; Privacy leakages; Privacy protection; Product traceability; Protection schemes; Security risks; Shared data; Traceability systems; Unauthorized access; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123992012"

By mid-decade, with full country wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters in place \citeinfo. Collection of fine-grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks associated with fine-grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy of users. With this technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping cycle, number of occupants, and even type and number of appliances stream into the hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse. This research paper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected from smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection while allowing benefits of energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the successful application of occupancy detection attacks using a deep neural network method that yields high accuracy results. We then introduce Adversarial Machine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance with Blockchain (AMLODA-B) framework as a counter-attack by deploying an algorithm based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model into the standardized smart metering infrastructure to prevent leakage of consumer's personal information. Our privacy-aware approach protects consumers' privacy without compromising the correctness of billing and preserves operational efficiency without use of authoritative intermediaries. © 2021 ACM.","adversarial machine learning; blockchain; long short term memory; neural networks; privacy preserving; smart meter","Blockchain; Data Analytics; Data streams; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Embedded systems; Energy conservation; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Privacy by design; Smart meters; Information exchanges; Neural network method; Occupancy detections; Operational efficiencies; Personal information; Privacy protection; Privacy violation; Utility companies; Consumer protection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107448668"

There is an urgent demand for a blockchain transaction scheme with privacy protection and supervision functions to ensure the security and controllability of Energy Internet transactions. In order to solve the problem that the traditional blockchain application modes are difficult to simultaneously take into account the two aspects of transaction data hiding and supervision, a privacy protection model of blockchain transaction with supervision function is proposed. It uses the probabilistic public-key encryption algorithm to realize the hiding of the true identity of the blockchain transaction users, and uses the commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof technology to realize the privacy protection of the transaction amounts. With the use of identity-based encryption, the supervision of blockchain transactions is realized by regulators, which greatly reduces the pressure on storage, computing and key management. System application analysis shows that the proposed scheme is simple and practical, and can meet the requirements of business applications. © 2021 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.","Blockchain; Energy Internet; Privacy protection; Transaction supervision","Blockchain; Digital storage; Privacy by design; Storage as a service (STaaS); Business applications; Business transaction; Identity Based Encryption; Privacy protection; Privacy protection model; Public key encryption algorithms; System applications; Zero knowledge proof; Public key cryptography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114144319"

However, sharing data poses challenges around privacy and accessibility, particularly in the event of disputes between stakeholders with a shared interest, such as a supply chain. Auditors currently rely on stakeholders' compliance in order to verify data. Malicious parties may falsify the data before passing it onto the auditor. Using supply chains as a case study we present BlockTorrent, a protocol to address these challenges and help facilitate data sharing between supply chain participants. BlockTorrent allows participants to securely share their data in near real-time with other participants without the risk of information leakage or allowing the falsification of data, whilst guaranteeing data availability for auditors. This is achieved using a novel combination of distributed storage and on-chain secret sharing. This paper provides an implementation and evaluation of BlockTorrent, highlighting its performance and a security discussion. Lastly, we provide a discussion on the privacy challenges that were considered when designing BlockTorrent. © 2021 IEEE.","BitTorrent; Blockchain; IoT; Multi-Stakeholder; Supply Chain","Compliance control; Crime; Digital storage; Internet of things; Privacy-preserving techniques; Supply chains; Bit torrents; Block-chain; Case-studies; Data availability; Data Sharing; Multi-stakeholder; Multiple stakeholders; Near-real time; Privacy preserving; Private data; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125658231"

Recently, blockchain has gained extensive attention with its prominent characteristics as public, distributed, decentration and chronological characteristics. However, the transaction information on the blockchain is open to all nodes, the transaction information update operation is even more transparent. And the leakage of transaction information will cause huge losses to the transaction party. In response to these problems, this paper combines hierarchical attribute encryption with linear secret sharing, and proposes a blockchain data privacy protection control scheme based on searchable attribute encryption, which solves the privacy exposure problem in traditional blockchain transactions. The user's access control is implemented by the verification nodes, which avoids the security risks of submitting private keys and access structures to the blockchain network. Associating the private key component with the random identity of the user node in the blockchain can solve the collusion problem. In addition, authorized users can quickly search and supervise transaction information through searchable encryption. The improved algorithm ensures the security of keywords. Finally, based on the DBDH hypothesis, the security of the scheme is proved in the random prediction model. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Based on FL, we premodel sent a novel and decentralized approach to training encrypted models with privacy-preserved data on Blockchain. In our approach, Blockchain is adopted as the machine learning environment where different actors (i.e., the model provider, the data provider) collaborate on the training task.

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; dynamic key management; fine-grained access control; Internet of Things (IoT); privacy preserving; smart healthcare","Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Health care; Dynamic key managements; Fine grained; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy preserving; Remote monitoring; Security analysis; Smart healthcare systems; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073422904"

But here the question of trust arises as the data will go through many phases for the analysis by different parties. The data may contain some sensitive or private information that can be miss utilized by the organizations involved in the analysis stages. So it is needed for the hour to consider the data privacy issues very seriously. Data privacy refers to how to control the use of a piece of data by its relative importance. For example, someone will not hesitate to say his/her name to strangers but will not share mobile no. address until the stranger becomes familiar. In this digital age, the personal use of data privacy generally applied to critical personal information. From a business point of view, data privacy operates in a broader sense beyond the critical information of employees customers. There is a general conclusion that AI Machine Learning driven technologies are obstructed by data privacy issues as the ML uses large data sets to train test. But can the obstacle block convert to a stepping stone? Yes, It can be. Imagine a scenario where no one is trust-able, so in that case, Blockchain enters the scene. Blockchain uses the data but in an anonymity way. So in this paper, we are proposing a way, how to combine Machine Learning Blockchain to ensure data privacy. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Data Analysis; Data Privacy; Encryption; Integration; Machine Learning","Blockchain; Machine learning; Turing machines; Digital age; Integrating machines; Large datasets; Personal information; Personal use; Privacy issue; Private information; Stepping stone; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096562521"

Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for verification of encrypted data. © 2019 IEEE.","","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Ethereum; Outsourcing; Cloud servers; Encrypted data; Privacy preserving; Publicly verifiable; Query results; Security analysis; Security design; Verifiable designs; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070237152"

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for integrity and privacy-preserving IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing technologies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial data. Moreover, access to user data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, users' data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution also conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Lastly, we present a system of reward in the form of a digital token “PrivyCoin” for the users for sharing their data with the stakeholders/third parties.

However, in open network environment, different wireless communication technologies make all these information vulnerable to various attacks and compromises. The users' private information is put at the risk of leaking at any time.

We leverage broadcast encryption, key regression, data privacy classification, blockchain and smart contract holistically to address such a challenge. In our design, a patient’s medical records are divided into multiple parts with different sensitivities according to personal privacy requirements. Each part is encrypted with a symmetric encryption key and it is broadcast encrypted to a pre-defined user set. Data encryption keys are generated by a key regression scheme, where keys used to encrypt low-sensitivity data parts can be derived from keys used to encrypt high-sensitivity data parts. With such a mechanism, we can enforce strict access and privacy control on medical data. Furthermore, we use Ethereum blockchain to connect various institutions to provide efficient data sharing, and we design smart contracts to implement the business logic of medical data sharing. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Privacy; Security; Smart contracts","Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Parallel architectures; Broadcast encryption; Data encryption; High sensitivity; Personal privacy; Privacy classifications; Privacy control; Privacy preserving; Symmetric encryption; Data Sharing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092727411"

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties.

However, electronic medical data are stored in isolated data silos within each hospital due to the privacy and competition. Because of the complex interests of various groups, there is a lack of data flow between medical entities. On the one hand, this leads to difficulties for patients to obtain their own electronic medical data and to referral between different hospitals. On the other hand, it has led to serious lack of actual data for medical researchers. The realization of the determination of medical data ownership is the first condition for realizing medical data circulation. How to retrieve the required medical data while protecting privacy is the second problem to be solved. In this paper, we design the medical metadata as the smallest subunit of data ownership confirmation and propose a blockchain-based medical data sharing Framework MDSF, which can be used for electronic medical data ownership confirmation and data search while protecting patient privacy. We use the petri nets to verify the system and prove its reachability and boundedness, which means it can realize its designed function and operate safely. The system provides users with a convenient and safe way to obtain their past medical data, also enables research institutions engaged in medical data mining to easily search and obtain the actual medical data needed after desensitization. Thereby the circulation of medical data between different hospitals, individuals and research institutions is realized. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Data ownership confirmation; Data search; Electronic medical data; Petri nets","Blockchain; Data mining; Data Sharing; Hospitals; Petri nets; Privacy by design; Search engines; Data mining technology; Data ownership; Data searches; Medical data mining; Medical researchers; Patient privacies; Reachability; Research institutions; Medical computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097176162"

Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers.

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs. © 2018 IEEE.","","Access control; Blockchain; Data privacy; Health care; Medical computing; Access control mechanism; Access permissions; Content extraction; Critical approach; Electronic medical record; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Quality of health care; Electronic document exchange","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063464219"

We give a brief history of these technologies in medicine, outlining some of the challenges with successful use. We then explore a more detailed combination of usage with an emphasis on decentralizing or federating the learning process along with auditability and incentivization blockchain can allow in the machine learning process.

In other situations where personally identifying information is not needed to perform analyses, studies have shown that anonymization approaches such as k-anonymity or l-diversity cannot safeguard the information from inadvertent or malicious exposure.

Smart meters face serious security challenges, such as a trusted third party or a trusted authority being attacked, which leads to the disclosure of user privacy. Blockchain provides a viable solution that can use its key technologies to solve this problem. Blockchain is a new type of decentralized protocol that does not require a trusted third party or a central authority. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized privacy-preserving data aggregation (DPPDA) scheme for smart grid based on blockchain. In this scheme, the leader election algorithm is used to select a smart meter in the residential area as a mining node to build a block. The node adopts Paillier cryptosystem algorithm to aggregate the user’s power consumption data. Boneh-Lynn-Shacham short signature and SHA-256 function are applied to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, which is convenient for billing and power regulation. The scheme protects user privacy data while achieving decentralization, without relying on TTP or CA. Security analysis shows that our scheme meets the security and privacy requirements of smart grid data aggregation. The experimental results show that this scheme is more efficient than existing competing schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead. © 2020 by the authors.

Fortunately, the emergence of blockchain technology provides excellent properties of decentralization, verifiability and high reliability for secure multi-party computation. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based secure multi-party computation architecture for data sharing, where we design an aggregator consortium for data storage, verification and joint computation. Moreover, we introduce a straightforward secure multi-party computation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. In addition, we analyze and discuss this scheme in terms of data security, access flexibility, attack resistance and potential applications. © 2020 ACM.","Blockchain; Homomorphic encryption; Privacy protection; Secure multi-party computation","Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Complex computation; Data integrity; High reliability; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Individual privacy; Privacy protection; Secure multi-party computation; Verifiability; Data Sharing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086145330"

Many of these issues are raised due to absentiseem of direct control by doctors and patients over the innovation that serves them. As these innovations empower secure credentialing of authorized professionals and audit of clinical exchanges without the cooperation of a doctor’s facility or state middle person, we have actualized health data innovation that is bought and controlled by the people in the clinical relationship. A Blockchain is an open Distributed Ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently, verifiable and permanent way. This empowers every patient and each authorized specialist to claim and totally control their open source associated health records inside a protected situation. The aim is to study concepts and techniques of blockchain and to understand how blockchain technology works for different applications in different scenarios.

The integrity and availability of medical data are the basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the patient’s key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF to a blockchain application. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Availability; Blockchain; Integrity; Medical data; Privacy","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Exchange; Humans; accident; adult; article; control strategy; human; privacy; sibling; simulation; computer security; confidentiality; electronic health record; medical information system; organization and management; standards","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059493183"

Family Deed Certificate is a family identity that contains data about arrangements, relationships, and the number of family members. A family certificate is an essential thing for every citizen to have. However, related problems that occur are still using conventional systems that cause problems such as loss of family deed, and various manipulations of identity data. Thus, from this problem emerged a solution to guarantee all data and information security using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a technology for recording transactions with modern technology, which can only be added but cannot be changed or replaced. Blockchain technology can support various fields such as banking, education, health, and priorities for governance. For this research, this is applied in the field of government, which is a blockchain technology family certificate, various problems in terms of a family certificate that is a copy of a lot of family member data, and editing a deed of change, is very inflexible. With the family certificate system, blockchain technology, data security can be guaranteed so that there is no data falsification and can replace any loss on the family deed.

However, it has a problem in ensuring the privacy of user data due to its public nature. Data on a blockchain is public and can reveal someone’s personal data or transactions. Many applications that venture in blockchain such as financial applications, Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare applications can fall victim to revelation of personal data and linking attack. Many solutions such as automated access-control protocol that does not require a third party, a local miner operating in a local private blockchain that enforces users’ access control policy, a cryptographic protocol that lets contractual parties interact by using zero-knowledge proof, and computation of data query in a distributed way by using secure multi-party computation have been proposed to tackle this privacy issue in using blockchain. Hence, this paper provides a review on the current solutions that addresses the privacy issues of blockchain in different platforms.

Data analytics has entered the field of education under the name of learning analytics. Data analytics can provide insights that can be used to enhance learning activities for educational stakeholders, as well as helping online learning applications providers to enhance their services. However, despite the goodwill in the use of Edtech, some service providers use it as a means to collect private data about the students for their own interests and benefits. This is showcased in recent cases seen in media of bad use of students’ personal information. This growth in cases is due to the recent tightening in data privacy regulations, especially in the EU. The students or their parents should be the owners of the information about them and their learning activities online. Thus they should have the right tools to control how their information is accessed and for what purposes. Currently, there is no technological solution to prevent leaks or the misuse of data about the students or their activity. It seems appropriate to try to solve it from an automation technology perspective. In this paper, we consider the use of Blockchain technologies as a possible basis for a solution to this problem.

However, the paper prescription is not easy to store and its confidentiality is low, if it is lost, it will cause unnecessary trouble to the patient. Therefore, the use of digital prescriptions has been considered for future electronic medical record reform. The challenges of digital prescriptions are also upfront, for instance, it contains a large amount of patient's medical record information and private information, how to effectively maintain the level of security while the premise of privacy has caused a series of hot issues, which become a major concerns of people who promote the use of digital prescriptions. In recent years, blockchain has been widely regarded as a promising online business data and transaction security technology. Due to its decentralization, security and credibility, collective maintenance, and non-tampering, it is widely used in data storage and sharing. This paper proposes a blockchain-based medical prescription system. At the same time, in order to effectively protect the privacy of patients, during this period we adapted the k-anonymity algorithm and incorporated a differential privacy protection mechanism to enhance its secured performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; component; Differential privacy; K-anonymity; prescription","Blockchain; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Medical computing; Patient treatment; Privacy by design; Differential privacies; Electronic medical record; Medical prescription; Medical record; National level; Online business; Private information; Security technology; Electronic document exchange","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102727945"

Yet, customers have become reluctant to share data due to privacy concerns. From a psychological perspective, a reduction of users' perceived risks should result in a higher willingness to share sensitive data. The development of blockchain-supported, multi-part computation thereby represents an interesting novel empirical context to study such willingness to disclose personal data, as such technologies involve a privacy-preserving approach that could not only technically solve privacy issues but also ought to address precisely the user's risk perception. Therefore, we conducted an online experiment with 420 participants to examine the willingness to disclose personal data dependent on different privacy protection mechanisms. A deception based experiment allowed to measure not only user intention, but also real user behavior. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that participants shared similar amounts of personal data for blockchain-supported approaches and standard privacy policies. Even though an aversion to the blockchain system due to its novelty and potentially perceived complexity was not detected. Furthermore, we found that the willingness to share data increased significantly specifically for technically affine people when they were presented with the opportunity to monetize their data. We further discuss the effects of privacy awareness and whether prior knowledge of blockchain technology had a supporting effect for user acceptance. © 2017 IEEE.","blockchain; data privacy; personal data; privacy-preserving system; user behavior","Behavioral research; Blockchain; Risk perception; On-line experiments; Privacy awareness; Privacy policies; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Supporting effect; User behaviors; Willingness to share; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046537326"

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost. © 2019 IEEE.","Blockchain; Smart contract; Symmetric searchable encryption","Cryptography; Data structures; Digital storage; Efficiency; Multiprocessing systems; Search engines; Computational costs; Distributed storage system; Enhanced efficiency; Intermediate results; Privacy preservation; Privacy preserving; Recent researches; Searchable encryptions; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078694957"

Despite the advantages, users must rely on storage services for data confidentiality, data access control, user privacy, and data availability. Whereas data confidentiality can be protected by advanced encryption algorithms, the rest remain challenging. First, in existing centralized storage services, even though data access controls are mainly defined by data owners, they are maintained and enforced by the services, which can deny data retrieval requests of authorized users or allow requests of illegitimate users. Second, the identity of a user is often known to the services to verify its eligibility to access requested data according to the access control, thus making the user traceable in the system. More importantly, the lack of anonymity may make users reluctant to use such services in sensitive contexts. Third, a huge amount of data is daily generated and stored on a centralized party, simultaneously serving requests from many users, which may cause a collapse of the system during peak periods. To address all these concerns, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based data sharing platform for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a content-addressable peer-to-peer storage system. The platform allows protecting both user anonymity, data confidentiality, and provides high data availability due to being deployed upon the IPFS network. © 2020 IFIP.","anonymous access control; decentralized data storage; hidden transaction; predicate encryption; ring signature","Access control; Blockchain; Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Outsourcing; Peer to peer networks; Storage as a service (STaaS); Data access control; Data availability; Data confidentiality; Data-sharing platforms; Encryption algorithms; Outsourcing solution; Peer-to-peer storage systems; Privacy preserving; Data Sharing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090025938"

They provide a convenient way to collect patient data, but they also bring serious problems which are mainly reflected in the safe storage of the collected data. The privacy and security of data storage in WBAN devices cannot meet the needs of WBAN users. Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user’s data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN. In addition, the new signature scheme can also compress the size of the blockchain storage space. © 2019 by the authors.

The VANET has been used to improve driving safety and construct an ITS in modern cities. However, owing to the wireless characteristics, the message transmitted through the network can be observed, altered, or forged. Since driving safety is a major part of VANET, the security and privacy of these messages must be preserved. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient privacy-preserving data transmission architecture that makes use of blockchain technology in cluster-based VANET. The cluster-based VANET architecture is used to achieve load balancing and minimize overhead in the network, where the clustering process is performed using the rainfall optimization algorithm (ROA). The ROA-based clustering with blockchain-based data transmission, called a ROAC-B technique, initially clusters the vehicles, and communication takes place via blockchain technology. A sequence of experiments was conducted to ensure the superiority of the ROAC-B technique, and several aspects of the results were considered. The simulation outcome showed that the ROAC-B technique is superior to other techniques in terms of packet delivery ratio (PDR), end to end (ETE) delay, throughput, and cluster size. © 2020 by the authors.

Then, we formulate the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating privacy-preserved federated learning. The privacy of data is well-maintained by sharing the data model instead of revealing the actual data. Finally, we integrate federated learning in the consensus process of permissioned blockchain, so that the computing work for consensus can also be used for federated training. Numerical results derived from real-world datasets show that the proposed data sharing scheme achieves good accuracy, high efficiency, and enhanced security. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Data sharing; federated learning; industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); permissioned blockchain, privacy-preserved","Blockchain; Data privacy; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Losses; Quality of service; Emerging applications; federated learning; High-efficiency; Machine learning problem; Numerical results; permissioned blockchain, privacy-preserved; Real-world datasets; Security and privacy; Data Sharing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081670877"

In this paper, we propose a homomorphic consortium blockchain for SHS sensitive data privacy preserving (HCB-SDPP), which is based on the traditional smart home system. We add verification services, which are composed of verification nodes, to our model to verify working nodes and transactions in SHS. In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model. If these nodes are insecure, the influence on the whole model will be analyzed. The simulation result shows that the HCB-SDPP model can protect customer privacy more effectively than SHS. © 2013 IEEE.","consortium blockchain; homomorphic encryption; Privacy preserving; smart home systems","Automation; Blockchain; Cryptography; Solar buildings; Customer privacy; Device information; Encrypted algorithms; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Privacy preserving; Privacy protection; Sensitive datas; Smart-home system; Data privacy","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066789912"

In this context, license plate recognition (LPR) systems have been used by public safety forces to monitor vehicle movement. However, current systems store vehicle location data indistinctly, without differentiating vehicles that are under criminal investigation from those that are not. This monitoring may be used to infer personal data about the owner of the vehicle, resulting in a violation of privacy by disregarding data protection laws. This paper presents a study about the use of technologies to ensure privacy in the Internet of Things and proposes a model to protect data collected by LPR systems.

Earlier studies indicate that the blockchain technology is found to be a significant solution to resolve the challenges of data security exist in IoT. In this view, this paper presents a new privacy-preserving Secure Ant Colony optimization with Multi Kernel Support Vector Machine (ACOMKSVM) with Elliptical Curve cryptosystem (ECC) for secure and reliable IoT data sharing. This program uses blockchain to ensure protection and integrity of some data while it has the technology to create secure ACOMKSVM training algorithms in partial views of IoT data, collected from various data providers. Then, ECC is used to create effective and accurate privacy that protects ACOMKSVM secure learning process. In this study, the authors deployed blockchain technique to create a secure and reliable data exchange platform across multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and recorded in a distributed ledger. The security analysis showed that the specific data ensures confidentiality of critical data from each data provider and protects the parameters of the ACOMKSVM model for data analysts. To examine the performance of the proposed method, it is tested against two benchmark dataset such as Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set (BCWD) and Heart Disease Data Set (HDD) from UCI AI repository. The simulation outcome indicated that the ACOMKSVM model has outperformed all the compared methods under several aspects. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

To establish an immutable data provenance scheme for CPS, the authors adopt blockchain and propose a decentralized architecture to assure data integrity. In business-driven CPS, end users are required to share their personal information with multiple third parties. To prevent data leakage and preserve user privacy, the authors isolate and feed different information retrieval requests using tokens specifically generated for each type of request. Providing both traceability of data operations, and unlinkability of end user activities, a robust blockchain-based CPS is prototyped.

In 2016, a large-scale DDoS attack, named Dyn, caused massive damage to several well-known companies. One effective countermeasure is observing previous network traffic information or abnormal behavior determined by the host machines and determining the latest DDoS-attack IP addresses. Because of the lack of a fair exchange mechanism, most security operation centers (SOCs) are unwilling to share their real-time DDoS data. In this article, we propose a decentralized DDoS data exchange platform, namely SOChain, using blockchain technology to overcome the trust and fairness issues. The platform incentivizes SOCs through the DDoS_coin token. The more DDoS information an SOC contributes, the more coins it earns. To confirm the validity of uploaded information, we enlist a content verifier to examine uploaded abnormal IP addresses. Moreover, the verifier is incentivized by the DDoS_coin. To decrease the management effort, the entire flow is automatically executed in smart contract deployed onto the blockchain system. To address the issue of privacy in smart contracts, we devise a novel dual-level Bloom filter to enable efficient searches with privacy protection.

On one side the general availability of the data is vital in emergency situations and supports heavily the different research, population health management and development activities, on the other side using the same data can lead to serious social and ethical problems caused by malicious actors. Currently, the regulation of the privacy data varies all over the world, however underlying principles are always defensive and protective towards patient privacy against general availability. The protective principles cause a defensive, data hiding attitude of the health system developers to avoid breaching the overall law regulations. It makes the policy makers and different - primarily drug - developers to find ways to treat data such a way that lead to ethical and political debates. In our paper we introduce how the blockchain technology can help solving the problem of secure data storing and ensuring data availability at the same time. We use the basic principles of the American HIPAA regulation, which defines the public availability criteria of health data, however the different local regulations may differ significantly.

Individuals can transact in an anonymous but transparent manner. Their identities remain hidden but the records of their transactions are publicly available. This has had its benefits in certain application areas but might not be suited for transactions where it is important to know who you are dealing with and in circumstances where the data in the blockchain might be confidential. Private blockchain networks are better suited for such transactions as only authorized users can transact on the network. Sensitive data can also be stored on the blockchain as it is possible to restrict the users that can see the details of the transactions. This paper describes how to create a private blockchain network and how other users can join the network. It also details the benefits of using a private blockchain network with regards to data privacy as opposed to a public network. © 2020 IEEE.","Blockchain; Ethereum; Privacy; Proof-of-Authority","Privacy by design; Application area; Authorized users; Digital world; Public networks; Sensitive datas; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101130371"

An example of these risks is the presence of a third party between users and various services, which leads to the collection and control of large amounts of users' personal information and the possibility of their databases being misused or hacked. Blockchain technology and encrypted currencies have so far shown that a decentralized network of peer-to-peer users, along with a general ledger, can do reliable computing. So, in this article, we are going to introduce a protocol that converts the blockchain network to an automated access control manager without the presence of a third party. To this end, we designed a mutual authentication protocol to create a secure channel between the user and the service and then demonstrate its accuracy and completeness using the Gong-Nidham-Yahalom belief logic [1]. The results of our evaluations show that our proposed protocol is secure enough to be used on the blockchain network and attackers are unable to penetrate, track, impersonate, inject, misrepresent or distort information using the common attacks. © 2020 MECS.","Access Control; Authentication Protocol; Blockchain; Decentralized Personal Data Management; Privacy; Secure Channel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086047025"

Decentralization of these cloud data can minimize the effect of attacks. Storing and running computation on sensitive private healthcare data in cloud are possible by decentralization which is enabled by peer to peer (P2P) network. By leveraging the decentralized or distributed property, blockchain technology ensures the accountability and integrity. Different solutions have been proposed to control the effect of attacks using decentralized approach but these solutions somehow failed to ensure overall privacy of patient centric systems.

However, it still faces many challenges in data heterogeneity, interoperability, and privacy protection. In response to the above problems, a decentralized medical big data sharing model based on ring signature is constructed. The model maintains a reliable medical ledger database based on the decoupling of blockchain, ensuring that the privacy data cannot be tampered. It constructs a private data storage protocol based on ring signature, which guarantees medical data and patient identity privacy with its full anonymity. We proposed a medical information strict access control management mechanism based on smart contract automation execution of preset instructions. The authority and confidentiality of medical privacy data are guaranteed by clearly dividing the access rights of medical privacy information. The safety test results show that the model has better real-time and robustness than the traditional medical big data sharing model. © 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; encrypted Internet of Things (IoT) data; homomorphic cryptosystem (HC); machine learning (ML); privacy protection","Anomaly detection; Blockchain; Computer aided diagnosis; Cryptography; Data privacy; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Smart city; Support vector machines; Data-sharing platforms; Homomorphic cryptosystem; Internet of Things (IOT); Polynomial multiplication; Privacy protection; Real-world scenario; Secure building blocks; Trusted third parties; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069186132"

Therefore, this paper takes the implementation mode of blockchain smart contract in smart home privacy protection as an application example to analyze the application value of blockchain in the privacy protection of Internet of things. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Blockchain; Information management; Internet of things; Application examples; Continuous development; Data privacy protections; Distributed nodes; Management mechanisms; Privacy protection; Privacy protection model; Social economic system; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097611281"

However, due to the scattered and distributed nature of digital healthcare records, accessing data for analytics has become a huge challenge. The main reason for that is data custodians being reluctant to disseminate the records to the external entities due to security and privacy concerns. As the ultimate ownership of medical records lies with the individual patient, this is best resolved by integrating patient consent with existing access control mechanisms. Recently, blockchain has been shown as a promising technology to provide secure and privacy-preserving data sharing on distributed and decentralized environments. Therefore, to cater the requirement of privacy-preserving data acquisition for clinical data analytics in the modern digital health networks, we propose a dynamic consent management architecture leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts adhering to six key design goals. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

In recent years, a large number of privacy-preservation data aggregation schemes have been proposed for smart grid, which relies on trusted third party (TTP) or central authority (CA). If the TTP or CA fails, these schemes become insecure. Therefore, this paper proposes a smart grid data aggregation scheme based on blockchain, which does not rely on TTP or CA and achieves decentralization. In this scheme, the leader election algorithm is used to select a smart meter in the residential area as a mining node to build a block. The node adopts Paillier cryptosystem algorithm to aggregate the user’s electricity consumption data. The confidentiality and integrity of user data are guaranteed, which is convenient for billing and power regulation.

In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients’ identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals.
