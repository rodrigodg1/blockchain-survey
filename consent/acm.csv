Fitness wearables devices record a considerable amount of sensitive and private details about exercise, blood oxygen level, and heart rate. Privacy concerns have emerged about the interactions between an individual’s raw fitness data and data analysis by the providers of fitness apps and wearable devices. This paper describes the importance of adopting and applying legal frameworks within the fitness tracker ecosystem. In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management. After discussing feasible solutions, we conclude by describing how blockchain is suitable for solving these privacy issues.","Privacy, Consent Criteria, Legal Framework, Data Protection, Wearable Devices, Fitness Provider, Consent Management, Fitness Data","","ACSW '22"

The adoption of these novel approaches is expanding rapidly on the road to what is now termed Society 5.0. However, leaving aside all the potential benefits that come from the interaction with these novel systems, an increasing number of people are concerned with the amount of data these systems can collect and share with data requesters. Several legal frameworks call for the adoption of practices regarding data protection and pushing for data control by the data owners. Unfortunately, most human-centric IoT-based systems lack mechanisms for managing resources and data in the user domain. Moreover, these tasks are typically delegated to a central entity; this necessarily implies a relationship of trust and can lead to problems related to transparency. To cope with these issues in this paper we present a privacy-preserving model that leverages the intrinsic features of the blockchain technology for consent management and transparency in Human-Centered Internet of Things environments. To show the feasibility of our approach, the proposed model is implemented, deployed in a test environment, and assessed using realistic scenarios.","consent, transparency, human-centered, internet of things, privacy, blockchain","","IoTDI '23"

Cross-enterprise document sharing (XDS) is the crucial system of sharing personalized healthcare data. Furthermore, dynamic consent is vital to the XDS system, because it respects people's autonomy and achieves recognition of data sovereignty. Because of its transparency, blockchain is a powerful system for managing storage and computing without a trusted third party. Besides, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) extends public-key encryption by implying access control policies in ciphertexts, making it suitable for protecting the privacy of individual healthcare data in versatile cases. Particularly, we use hospital name, ""date"" and ""department"" as attribute strings in the access control policies. Consequently, based on consortium blockchain and CP-ABE, we propose a patient-centered XDS and a dynamic consent framework. Compared with previous related literature, we make the proposed framework consistent with current practices and achieve favorable criteria, such as data confidentiality, data recoverability and time-aware ciphertext.

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus.We believe that this focus on consensus protocols only explains part of the story. To investigate this belief, we raise a simple question: Can a well-crafted system using a classical consensus protocol outperform systems using modern protocols? In this tutorial, we answer this question by diving deep into the design of blockchain systems. Further, we take an in-depth look at the theory behind consensus, which can help users select the protocol that best-fits their requirements. Finally, we share our vision of high-throughput blockchain systems that operate at large scales.","","",""

However, in fact, even the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm cannot fundamentally guarantee that transaction information is real and legitimate in reality. Therefore, the normal operation of the blockchain system requires the establishment of a special supervisory body to audit the transaction information, which can ensure that the data sources are credible rather than spurious or illegal. In addition, in the environment of permissioned blockchain, the realization of access mechanism often relies on centralized certificate authority. Unfortunately, a highly centralized management entity is not entirely trustworthy and reliable because it may be corrupt or attacked, which inevitably triggers many information security incidents such as privacy leakage and data loss. In order to realize the secure governance of permissioned blockchain system, a novel multi-supervised permissioned blockchain (MSPB) model is proposed in this paper, which supports auditing and eliminates the centralized entities in the system, including certification authority and auditing authority. We evaluated the security and performance of the proposed model to demonstrate its feasibility, reliability and effectiveness.","Permissioned blockchain, Multi-supervised, System security, Information audit","","IECC '19"

Currently, the miner-validator architecture based on serial contract execution limits the throughput of smart contract execution to a great extent. This paper proposes a new smart contract parallel execution architecture, which migrates the concurrency control methods used in mature databases to the blockchain. The test of Ethereum data and a benchmark specifically for blockchain show that its throughput is greatly improved compared with the traditional serial execution mode.","Blockchain, Parallel execution, Schedule, Smart contract","","ICBTA '22"

However, research on auto-tuning for better performance has somewhat stagnated because of the difficulty posed by distributed parameters; thus, it is possible only with difficulty to propose an effective auto-tuning optimization scheme.

The key of Athena is designing a new Permissioned Blockchain Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PB-MADDPG) to realize heterogeneous parameter-tuning optimization of different types of nodes in Fabric. Moreover, we select parameters with the most significant impact on accelerating recommendation. In its application to Fabric, a typical permissioned blockchain system, with 12 peers and 7 orderers, Athena achieves a throughput improvement of 470.45% and a latency reduction of 75.66% over the default configuration.

It is deemed the key to ensuring the built-in integrity of information and security of immutability by design in the peer-to-peer network (P2P) of mobile devices. In a permissioned blockchain, the authority of the system has control over the identities of its users. Such information can allow an ill-intentioned authority to map identities with their spatiotemporal data, which undermines the location privacy of a mobile user. In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based IoT systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location (PoL) on their actual locations. We show that, in a permissioned blockchain with an authority and a presence of a PoL, existing approaches cannot be applied using a plug-and-play approach to protect location privacy. In this context, we propose BlockPriv, an obfuscation technique that quantifies, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship between privacy and utility in order to dynamically protect the privacy of sensitive locations in the permissioned blockchain.","smart mobile devices, blockchain, location privacy, IoT","","MobiQuitous '19"

However, performance bottlenecks seriously hinder the adoption of these systems in many industrial applications that process complex business logic and huge transaction volumes. Our research identifies two key factors that limit the system performance: 1) At the block level, the serial dependency of inter-block processing severely limits the system throughput. A new block must wait for the completion of all previous blocks. 2) At the transaction level, the lack of efficient intra-block transactions concurrency makes it difficult to achieve high performance, especially when dealing with multiple CPU-heavy contracts which are commonly used in industrial scenarios.In this paper, we present FISCO-BCOS, an enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain system with high performance. To overcome serial limitations and fully utilize machine resources, FISCO-BCOS introduces Block Level Pipelining (BLP) workflow to process blocks in a pipeline manner. In addition, a scheduling algorithm Deterministic Multi-Contract (DMC) is designed to efficiently execute transactions in parallel. Under BLP and DMC, FISCO-BCOS achieves inter-block and intra-block paralleling to meet high-performance requirements in industrial application scenarios. We conducted experiments on two popular test workloads and compared FISCO-BCOS with state-of-the-art platforms in academia and industry such as BIDL and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). The result shows that FISCO-BCOS achieves 7.4 times and 28.4 times the throughput of BIDL and HLF, respectively, with half the latency of them.

One of such challenges is the overhead of the communication which is required to execute the Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol that is needed for consensus building. As such, it may not be feasible to implement PBC for resource constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we assess the communication overhead of running BA in an IoT environment that consists of wireless nodes (e.g., Raspberry PIs) with meshing capabilities. As the the packet loss ratio is significant and makes BA unfeasible to scale, we propose a network coding based approach that will reduce the packet overhead and minimize the consensus completion time of the BA. Specifically, various network coding approaches are designed as a replacement to TCP protocol which relies on unicasting and acknowledgements.

Specifically, no distributed system can satisfy consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously. Informally, the innovative blockchain trilemma has been theorized to include security, scalability, and decentralization. While many software approaches on blockchains claim to solve the trilemma problem, almost all known approaches have been proven to involve trade-offs and fail to reach the upper bounds, meaning they do not achieve the theoretical limit value in each term of a trilemma. In this paper, we propose a general trilemma based on the above two. For permissioned blockchains, we then describe a system framework called GBT-CHAIN to solve the General Blockchain Trilemma. In the proposed framework, the consensus and data layer, the network layer and the physical layer work in cooperation. According to our theoretical proof and experimental analysis, the three properties of the trilemma consisting of consistency, scalability, and partition tolerance are perfectly satisfied without trade-offs. Our results demonstrate that the general blockchain trilemma is resolved by combining consensus algorithms and physical topologies, in particular for permissioned blockchains.","Trilemma, Partition tolerance, Scalability, Permissioned blockchain, Consistency","Just Accepted",""

We optimize inter-shard performance by clustering participants using their geographical properties, locality. In addition, the locality is also employed to decide the transaction placement which results in a low ratio of cross-shard transactions for applications, such as everyday banking, retail payments, and electric vehicle charging. We also propose a client-driven efficient mechanism to handle cross-shard transactions and present an analysis. This enables clients to manage their assets across different shards directly. A prototype is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric v2.3 and evaluated on Amazon EC2.

As a first contribution, we developed a consensus algorithm for private permissioned blockchains based on Hyperledger Fabric and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus. Building on this blockchain, five additional variations achieving various client-wise privacy preserving levels are proposed. These different protocols allow for different use cases and levels of privacy control and sometimes its revocation by an authority.

ECDSA is the most commonly used cryptographic scheme in permissioned blockchains. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of ECDSA signature verification on FPGA, in order to improve performance of permissioned blockchains that aim to use FPGA-based hardware accelerators. We propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom multipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced number of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF representation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules, we propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for fast verification of signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA verification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a precomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature verification. Our ECDSA engine running at 250MHz on Xilinx Alveo U250 accelerator card can perform a verification in 760 microseconds with a throughput of 1,315 verifications/second, which is 2.5 times faster than state-of-the-art FPGA-based implementations.

AI based on big data analysis and deep learning algorithms has become the core driving force for the future development of the medical industry, but the biggest obstacle to its development is incompleteness and inaccuracy of medical data. The main reason is that medical big data is difficult to achieve sharing. This paper studies and analyzes the problems of medical big data sharing, proposes a medical data sharing platform based on permissioned blockchains (BCs), which uses dual-BCs architecture (Account BC and transaction BC), Concurrent Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism, encryption technology and smart contract technology. Account BC (ABC) is used to store user data hash after encryption and transaction BC (TBC) is used to process computing tasks. The use of encryption technology ensures that users have full autonomy in their own medical data. Smart contract technology is used to enable users to set up different access permissions of medical data. A TBC can be used by multiple ABCs and TBC does not save users' medical data, but only obtains users' medical data from ABCs when needs computation. When the computing task is completed, the TBC deletes all users' medical data and packages the operation record to save into ABCs, thereby it realizes data sharing while protecting users' privacy. In addition, this paper compares the functions with other medical data systems, analyzes and compares their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the conclusions and future works of the medical data sharing platform based on BC technology are prospected.","Medical data, Medical data privacy, Medical data sharing, Permissioned blockchains, Smart contract","","ICBTA '18"

Namely, permissioned blockchains typically exhibit low latencies, compared to permissionless deployments—however at the cost of poor scalability. As a remedy, various solutions were proposed to capture “the best of both worlds”, targeting low latency and high scalability simultaneously. Among these, blockchain sharding emerges as the most prominent technique. Most existing sharding proposals exploit features of the permissionless model and are therefore restricted to cryptocurrency applications. A few permissioned sharding proposals exist, however, they either make strong trust assumptions on the number of faulty nodes or rely on trusted hardware or assume a static participation model where all nodes are expected to be available all the time. In practice, nodes may join and leave the system dynamically, which makes it challenging to establish how to shard and when. In this work, we address this problem and present Mitosis, a novel approach to practically improve scalability of permissioned blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of blockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical scalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing blockchain (and its participants) into two—reminiscent of mitosis, the biological process of cell division. Mitosis inherits the low latency of permissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel processing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose their own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to share information and assets—meeting high levels of interoperability. We analyse the security of Mitosis and evaluate experimentally the performance of our solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that Mitosis can be ported with little modifications and manageable overhead to existing permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric. As far as we are aware, Mitosis emerges as the first workable and practical solution to scale existing permissioned blockchains.","cross-chain communication, permissioned blockchains, dynamic sharding, scalability","","ACSAC '21"

This paper presents Qanaat, a scalable multi-enterprise permissioned blockchain system that guarantees the confidentiality of enterprises in collaboration workflows. Qanaat presents data collections that enable any subset of enterprises involved in a collaboration workflow to keep their collaboration private from other enterprises. A transaction ordering scheme is also presented to enforce only the necessary and sufficient constraints on transaction order to guarantee data consistency. Furthermore, Qanaat supports data consistency across collaboration workflows where an enterprise can participate in different collaboration workflows with different sets of enterprises. Finally, Qanaat presents a suite of consensus protocols to support intra-shard and cross-shard transactions within or across enterprises.","","",""

Unfortunately, all existing permissioned blockchain frameworks adopt sequential workflows for invoking the consensus protocol and executing applications' transactions, making the performance of these applications much lower than deploying them in traditional systems (e.g., in-datacenter stock exchange).We propose Bidl, the first permissioned blockchain framework highly optimized for datacenter networks. We leverage the network ordering in such networks to create a shepherded parallel workflow, which carries a sequencer to parallelize the consensus protocol and transaction execution speculatively. However, the presence of malicious participants (e.g., a malicious sequencer) can easily perturb the parallel workflow to greatly degrade Bidl's performance. To achieve stable high performance, Bidl efficiently shepherds all participants by detecting their misbehaviors, and performs denylist-based view changes to replace or deny malicious participants. Compared with three fast permissioned blockchain frameworks, Bidl's parallel workflow reduces applications' latency by up to 72.7% and improves their throughput by up to 4.3x in the presence of malicious participants. Bidl is suitable to be integrated with traditional stock exchange systems.

However, due to privacy issues, the data cannot be shared. Several Federated Learning (FL) systems have been introduced as private alternatives without considering Byzantine actors. Also, these systems are affected by the gradient staleness problem. Several blockchain-based FL systems are introduced to address Byzantine actors, which rely on Proof-of-Work-based (PoW) protocols and suffer from their limitations. We introduce OrderlessFL, a safe permissioned blockchain-based FL system using flCRDT, a CRDT for concurrent ML training and mitigating gradient staleness.","blockchain, conflict-free replicated data type, federated learning","","Middleware Demos and Posters '22"

It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require ""smart-contracts"" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.","","","EuroSys '18"

However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures.","Hyperledger Fabric, Eventual Consistency, CRDT, Multi-Version Concurrency Control, Blockchain","","Middleware '19"
