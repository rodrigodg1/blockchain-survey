Used within the context of biobanking, it gives individuals access to information and control to determine how and where their biospecimens and data should be used. We present Dwarna—a web portal for ‘dynamic consent’ that acts as a hub connecting the different stakeholders of the Malta Biobank: biobank managers, researchers, research partners, and the general public. The portal stores research partners’ consent in a blockchain to create an immutable audit trail of research partners’ consent changes. Dwarna’s structure also presents a solution to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation’s right to erasure—a right that is seemingly incompatible with the blockchain model. Dwarna’s transparent structure increases trustworthiness in the biobanking process by giving research partners more control over which research studies they participate in, by facilitating the withdrawal of consent and by making it possible to request that the biospecimen and associated data are destroyed. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,"Mamo, Nicholas (57201582128); Martin, Gillian M.

Various systems that adopts the blockchain in managing medical records have been proposed. However, there is a need for more work to better characterize, understand and evaluate the employment of blockchain technology in the healthcare industry. In this paper, a design of blockchain based system, namely MedChain, for managing medical records is proposed. MedChain is designed to improve the current systems as it provides interoperable, secure, and effective access for medical records by patients, health care providers, and other third parties, while keeping the patients' privacy. MedChain employs timed-based smart contracts for governing transactions and controlling accesses to electronic medical records. It adopts advanced encryption techniques for providing further security. This work proposes a new incentive mechanism that leverages the degree of health providers regarding their efforts on maintaining medical records and creating new blocks.

However, sensing technologies increase the complexity of data collection points, making it difficult for users to consent to data collection. One possible solution for improving transparency in the consent management process is the use of blockchain, an immutable and timestamped ledger. Objective: This study aims to provide a conceptual framework based on technology aimed at mitigating trust issues in the consent management process. Methods: The consent management process was modeled using established methodologies to obtain a mapping of trust issues. This mapping was then used to develop a conceptual framework based on previous monitoring and surveillance architectures for connected devices. Results: In this paper, we present a model that maps trust issues in the informed consent process; a conceptual framework capable of providing all the necessary underlining technologies, components, and functionalities required to develop applications capable of managing the process of informed consent for AAL, powered by blockchain technology to ensure transparency; and a diagram showing an instantiation of the framework with entities comprising the participants in the blockchain network, suggesting possible technologies that can be used. Conclusions: Our conceptual framework provides all the components and technologies that are required to enhance the informed consent process.

The protocol is based on the concept of Ronald L. Rivest published in the paper ‘Electronic Lottery Tickets as Micropayments’ (1997). The “lottery ticket” was designed for centralized systems where a trusted third party is required to provide payments, and in some scenarios, is also a lottery facilitator. The existing blockchain protocol cannot accommodate peer-to-peer “lottery” micropayments at least, without creating payment channels. Therefore, the implementation requires the development of an upgrade to the blockchain core. In the result, RandpayUTXO was introduced – an infinitely spendable zero output that requires the payee's signature to be published in the blockchain. Randpay is considered to be the first blockchain protocol to require the payee to sign the transaction by their private key. This is a significant feature to improve, not only microtransactions but also extend the use of the blockchain for legal deeds that require a payee's consent to be recognized in legal applications. The second important innovation of this research is the implementation of Blum's ‘coin flipping by telephone’ problem to design a ‘lottery ticket’ that does not require any third party to facilitate the lottery. The paper offers an analysis of the mathematical model, and proof of how ‘lottery’ can be beneficial, an API description is also added.

These devices sense a considerable amount of sensitive data processed by a centralized third party. While many researchers have thoroughly evaluated privacy issues surrounding wearable fitness trackers, no study has addressed privacy issues in trackers by giving control of the data to the user. Blockchain is an emerging technology with outstanding advantages in resolving consent management privacy concerns. As there are no fully transparent, legally compliant solutions for sharing personal fitness data, this study introduces an architecture for a human-centric, legally compliant, decentralized and dynamic consent system based on blockchain and smart contracts. Algorithms and sequence diagrams of the proposed system's activities show consent-related data flow among various agents, which are used later to prove the system's trustworthiness by formalizing the security requirements. The security properties of the proposed system were evaluated using the formal security modeling framework SeMF, which demonstrates the feasibility of the solution at an abstract level based on formal language theory.

Common challenges for designing such systems include prosumers' privacy and security threats. To this end, Blockchain-based solutions have gained a lot of attention, though most existing solutions have either employed permissionless blockchain, which is far from pragmatic for a P2P energy trading system with peers permitted to join or leave the network at their whim; or relatively secure yet inefficient permissioned blockchains. Hence, this article presents a flexible permissioned ascription (FPA) scheme that uses on-chain and off-chain permissioning scheme via Orion and Metamask wallet. It also employs contract permissioning through a JavaScript based chain code deployed over Hyperledger Besu (an Ethereum based permissioned Blockchain network) with istanbul byzantine fault tolerant (IBFT) 2.0 consensus algorithm. Additionally, the proposed framework is emulated for development of a working prototype for a P2P energy trading system. Its performance evaluation has been conducted and monitored with Grafana, Prometheus, Hyperledger Caliper, and Kibana for parameters such as latency, throughput, success rate, CPU time, block time, block behind time, memory usage, garbage collection (GC) time, and performance of the validator nodes. The latency of IBFT 2.0 was found five times lesser than that of Ethereum and two times lesser than HF RAFT and KAFKA under varying conditions. Also, the measured throughput was 1.5 times higher than RAFT and Kafka and three times higher than that of Ethereum. The average block confirmation time measured is 5-6 s. The GC usage measured very less, i.e., 0.5-0.8%, with the proposed framework. It has been observed that the proposed energy-trading framework provides an efficient performance for deploying, transferring, and querying the energy transaction to a P2P energy-trading Blockchain network when compared with other consensus mechanisms.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,,"Pradhan, Nihar Ranjan (57219549234); Singh, Akhilendra Pratap (57200827203); Kumar, Neeraj (57206866080); Hassan, Mohammad Mehedi (57201949986); Roy, Diptendu Sinha (36806630100)",57219549234; 57200827203; 57206866080; 57201949986; 36806630100,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,2465.0,2475.0,10.0,23.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110883347&doi=10.1109%2fTII.2021.3096832&partnerID=40&md5=196a23e618e7ef8e2481cde17bda01d1,Blockchain; hyperledger besu; off-chain; on-chain permissioning; peer-to-peer energy trading,Blockchain; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Decentralized energy; Energy sector; Energy trading; Fault-tolerant capability; High securities; Hybrid framework; Performance bottlenecks; Security threats; Smart power grids,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85110883347,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users. © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Zhou, Tong (57208686794); Li, Xiaofeng (57192491068); Zhao, He (56923918400)",57208686794; 57192491068; 56923918400,IEEE Access,8672629,39273.0,39287.0,14.0,37.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065336696&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2906637&partnerID=40&md5=d1e1e858756e00c0268cdeb97720a579,Blockchain; byzantine agreement protocols; consensus algorithm; data tokenization; directed acyclic graph,Directed graphs; Graph theory; Byzantine Agreement; Consensus algorithms; DAG structures; Data ownership; Digital information; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Open environment; Tokenization; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85065336696,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Jaiman V.; Urovi V.,A Consent Model for Blockchain-Based Health Data Sharing Platforms,2020.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014565,,,8,,,,,,,,,"In modern healthcare systems, the ability to share electronic health records is crucial for providing quality care and for enabling a larger spectrum of health services. Health data sharing is dependent on obtaining individual consent which, in turn, is hindered by a lack of resources. To this extent, blockchain-based platforms facilitate data sharing by creating a trusted distributed network of users. These users are enabled to share their data without depending on the time and resources of specific actors (such as the health services). In blockchain-based platforms, data governance mechanisms become very important due to the need to specify and monitor data sharing and data use conditions. In this article, we present a blockchain-based data-sharing consent model for access control over individual health data. We use smart contracts to dynamically represent the individual's consent over health data and to enable data requesters to search and access those data. The dynamic consent model extends to two ontologies: the Data Use Ontology (DUO) which models the individual consent of users and the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M), which describes queries from data requesters. We deploy the model on Ethereum blockchain and evaluate different data sharing scenarios. The contribution of this article consists of the creation of an individual consent model for health data sharing platforms. Such a model guarantees that individual consent is respected and that all the participants in the data sharing platform are accountable. The evaluation of our solution indicates that such a data sharing model provides a flexible decision-making approach over data usage by data requesters. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model is efficient and adapts to personalized access control policies in different data-sharing scenarios. © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Jaiman, Vikas (56766107800); Urovi, Visara (26636097100)",56766107800; 26636097100,IEEE Access,9159120,143734.0,143745.0,11.0,61.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090267095&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3014565&partnerID=40&md5=e243aadddf2d8dacccdfd444a54a60e8,Blockchain; data sharing; distributed ledgers; EHR exchange; individual consent,Access control; Blockchain; Decision making; Health; Monitoring; Ontology; Data governances; Data-sharing platforms; Distributed networks; Dynamic consents; Electronic health record; Experimental evaluation; Health-care system; Personalized access controls; Data Sharing,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,2-s2.0-85090267095,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional access control models require one centralized authority that stores all the information for access control and validates access rights. This single point of failure in IoT access control could lead to situations where a single breach can cause sensitive information leakage across the entire system. Various studies have been conducted to mitigate this security risk by introducing a decentralized architecture based on blockchain technology called BBAC. However, most BBAC models consider only a simple access control situation, which can lead to a 'the Greatest privilege problem'. This study proposes a novel access control model that enforces minimum privilege to an access token by the division and modification of access rights. As a result, we contributed to enhancing the practicality of the BBAC and mitigating risks that may arise in the delegation process.  © 2022 IEEE.",,,"Heo, Jeonghwa (57713249800); Jang, Heewoong (57712833700); Lee, Heejo (14024523600)",57713249800; 57712833700; 14024523600,"SysCon 2022 - 16th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, Proceedings",,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130790315&doi=10.1109%2fSysCon53536.2022.9773848&partnerID=40&md5=660f829a7182e233e3e81dc78a6aac6d,Access control model; BBAC; Blockchain; IoT,Access control models; Blockchain; Access control models; Access rights; BBAC; Block-chain; Centralised; Entire system; Information leakage; Security problems; Sensitive informations; Single point; Internet of things,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85130790315,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Peyrone N.; Wichadakul D.,A formal model for blockchain-based consent management in data sharing,2023.0,Scopus,,,,,,,10.1016/j.jlamp.2023.100886,,,134,,,,,,,,,"Consent is one of six legal bases for personal data processing mentioned in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a privacy law giving European Union (EU) citizens authority over personal data. It enforces software systems to collect, analyze, and share only necessary information (‘data minimization’) following the specific purpose (‘consent’). The GDPR defines consent as permission of individuals (‘data subjects’) to give organizations (‘data controllers’) processing their personal data. Without a data subject's consent, the data controller processes personal data unlawfully. Therefore, consent management is an essential component of a software system to build data subjects' trust and engagement. However, sharing data can lead to a potential loss of control over personal data, as data are across boundaries between software services. One of the significant risks is caused by a lack of developers' experience in data protection practices. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use blockchain technology to manage data subjects' informed consent for data sharing to build trust, transparency, and traceability to share data across software services. We formalized the semantics of smart contracts to extend the blockchain features to validate the consent authorization and manage the request-response interaction between the services. Furthermore, we used the Event-B method to describe the dynamic behavior of the proposed model and prove its correctness. Finally, we provided a mapping from the formal model to a smart contract class diagram and a prototype called SmartDataTrust implemented with solidity and Python REST API that developers can easily utilize. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,,"Peyrone, Neda (57216148972); Wichadakul, Duangdao (6603187694)",57216148972; 6603187694,Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming,100886,,,,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164672249&doi=10.1016%2fj.jlamp.2023.100886&partnerID=40&md5=081668cb24b02e551a16b650d4cbf02c,Consent management; Data protection; Event-B; GDPR; Privacy by design; Smart contracts,Authorization; Blockchain; Computer software; Data privacy; Information management; Semantics; Block-chain; Consent managements; Data controllers; Data Sharing; Data subjects; Event-B; Formal modeling; General data protection regulations; Software services; Software-systems; Smart contract,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85164672249,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing - crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain ""miners"". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata.

Mobile applications and websites access the sensors and use them in a variety of ways. Permission is required to access permission-imposed sensors, while users can access no-permission imposed sensors directly without any permission by using the generic sensor application programming interface (API). An attacker targets these sensors and makes smartphones vulnerable at the application and network level. Attackers gain access to sensor information and use it for various purposes like identifying personal identification numbers (PINs) and stealing personal information. This paper presents BPLMSBT, a novel Blockchain-based permission list for mitigating smartphone sensor-based threats by allowing benign users to access sensors through various channels. The permission list contains benign sources with sensor access permissions, while the blacklist contains malicious sources that access the sensors. Blockchain avoids the risks of centralized lists and maintains the list's integrity through the immutability feature. Experimental results indicate that the proposed defence mechanism consumes less overhead and is more efficient. An informal security analysis proved that the BPLMSBT is capable of protecting against various attacks.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.",,,"Manimaran, S. (57609682500); Sastry, V.N. (9279543900); Gopalan, N.P.

The data on the internet can be compromised and the performance can be bottlenecked. The solution to this problem is the blockchain technology. Reason for choosing this field is because blockchain is a new technology and now it is one of the most demanding field in the IT sector. Blockchain is based on peer-to-peer topology containing connected nodes. Each node has cryptographic hash of the previous node (no malicious or unauthorized node can enter the linked nodes), timestamp and relevant data. Blockchain provides resistance against the unwanted interference and modification of the data and each node has separate processing power thus enhancing security and performance of the host network. Permission-ed and Permission-less blockchain have their own properties and limitations and they can be used in different scenarios. In permission-less blockchain the nodes can be public, anyone can add nodes to increase the performance (Bitcoin), while permission-ed blockchain is used within enterprise or between enterprises where the nodes are private and new nodes need authorization to be added in link nodes. The aim of this paper is to study the permission-ed and permission less blockchain, their similarities and differences, some of the consensus algorithms they use.

We propose a service-oriented architecture, backed by blockchain technology, that enables: (1) tamper-proof and immutable storage of subject of care consents; (2) a fine-grained access control for protecting health data according to consents; and (3) auditing tasks for supervisory authorities (or subjects of care themselves) to assess that healthcare organizations comply with GDPR and granted consents. Standards for health information exchange and access control are adopted to guarantee interoperability. Access control events and the subject of care consents are maintained on a blockchain, providing a trusted collaboration between organizations, supervisory authorities, and individuals. A prototype of the architecture has been implemented as a proof of concept to evaluate the performance of critical components. The application of subject of care consent to control the treatment of personal health data in federated and distributed environments is a pressing concern. The experimental results show that blockchain can effectively support sharing consent and audit events among healthcare organizations, supervisory authorities, and individuals.  © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Roman-Martinez, Isabel (22942167400); Calvillo-Arbizu, Jorge (25026792100); Mayor-Gallego, Vicente J.

A flexible authorization model with strict access control policies is promising for electronic health record (EHR) sharing with security. In this paper, a blockchain-based multi-hop permission delegation scheme with controllable delegation depth for EHR sharing has been presented. We use the interplanetary file system (IPFS) for storing the original EHRs. Smart contracts and proxy re-encryption technology are implemented for permission delegation. In order to ensure data security, we use attribute-based encryption to provide fine-grained access control. Additionally, blockchain is used to achieve traceability and immutability. We deploy smart contracts so that the delegation depth can be set by delegators. Security analysis of the proposed protocol shows that our solution meets the designed goals.

This is due to existing centralized systems and intermediaries sharing the medical records with multiple stakeholders causing single point of failure, data tampering, correlation attack, loss of privacy and transparency. Besides this, patient's consent for personal health record sharing is neglected or restricted to one-time consent policy that fails to produce tamper-proof evidence in an irrefutable way. With the emergence of promising distributed ledger technology like blockchain makes it easy to realize the trust factors required for patient-controlled record sharing without relying on a centralized third parties.This work proposes a smart contract based blockchain solution/framework for patient consent management to achieve a secure health record exchange and its access in automated way. The proposed solution is implemented on a public blockchain called as Ethereum. The security analysis of smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities is conducted using auditing tools like Oyente and Surya.

In that, providing Healthcare for the elderly, people above the age of 60 is a tough nut to crack. The current situation depicts that elderly people prefer independent lifestyles free from outside intrusion which complicates monitoring their physical health at regular intervals. Physical intervention after the onset of COVID-19 is a possibility but should be avoided unless absolutely required due to the virus's aggressive nature. Considering all these problems, we devise a conceptual application framework of Consent Based Monitoring of Elderly with Blockchain. The application acts as a method by which we can monitor the patients at regular intervals in a secure and unbreachable manner. The application takes the consent of the patients on what data they want the application to collect and relay, and the users who can access the data including the medical professional. After this, the medical professional can analyze the data to find any anomalies and provide a diagnosis. Only with the aid of Google Authorization may the patient update the consent-based data. The novelty of the project lies in the usage of Blockchain to maintain anonymity and integrity of the consent based data. The consent based access control lists and policies are stored in Blockchain in a comprehensive schema. The Blockchain is a privately running test only Blockchain specifically used to implement decentralized application development. The backend of the application is solely responsible for uploading and querying the data while communicating with the private Blockchain. The application framework assumes that the patient's data has already been transmitted via smaller edge computing nodes.

As an evolving field of medicine, e-Health involves the electronic processing of a patient's personal, medical and other health-related data to improve healthcare delivery. Data captured from clinical interactions between patients and their care providers, as well as health data collected through medical sensors, provide a rich source of data, known as patient medical records (PMRs), which can be processed in various ways to enhance the delivery of healthcare services. However, indiscriminate processing of PMRs could potentially result in the violation of the security or privacy of patients. To ensure that PMRs are not processed in ways that could be harmful to the security or privacy of the patients, modern data protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires healthcare service provides to obtain the consent of a patient for any processing operation on their PMRs. The mechanism by which a patient exercises their right to control who can process their PMRs, when and for what purpose, is referred to as consent management in e-Health. Existing health information technology systems do not provide adequate support for consent management; there is a lack of transparency and auditability in the existing systems to monitor and ensure that healthcare service providers comply to the relevant data protection regulations in processing PMRs. The emerging blockchain technology offers an opportunity to design an e-Health consent management system that is compliant with modern data protection regulations such as GDPR. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an e-Health consent management framework, based on the state-of-the-art blockchain technologies, for processing PMRs. Our analysis confirms that our system satisfies the requirements for consent management in e-Health. © 2020 IEEE.",,,"Agbo, Cornelius C. (57203930116); Mahmoud, Qusay H.

Healthcare organizations also have difficulties in dealing with patient consent. The objective of this research is to develop a system for patients to manage their consent flexibly and for healthcare organizations to obtain patient consent efficiently for a variety of purposes. Methods: We introduce a new e-con-sent model, which uses a purpose-based access control scheme; it is implemented by a blockchain system using Hyperledger Fabric. All metadata of patient records, consents, and data access are written immutably on the blockchain and shared among participant organizations. We also created a blockchain chaincode that performs business logic managing patient consent. Results: We developed a prototype and checked business logics with the chaincode by validating doctors’ data access with purpose-based consent of patients stored in the blockchain. The results demonstrate that our system provides a fine-grained way of handling medical staff ’s access requests with diverse intended purposes for accessing data. In addition, patients can create, update, and withdraw their consents in the blockchain. Conclusions: Our consent model is a solution for consent management both for patients and healthcare organizations.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations - which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance - specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance.

Our goal is to implement a process allowing for collection of patients' informed consent, which is bound to protocol revisions, storing and tracking the consent in a secure, unfalsifiable and publicly verifiable way, and enabling the sharing of this information in real time. For that, we build a consent workflow using a trending technology called Blockchain. This is a distributed technology that brings a built-in layer of transparency and traceability. From a more general and prospective point of view, we believe Blockchain technology brings a paradigmatical shift to the entire clinical research field. We designed a Proof-of-Concept protocol consisting of time-stamping each step of the patient's consent collection using Blockchain, thus archiving and historicising the consent through cryptographic validation in a securely unfalsifiable and transparent way. For each protocol revision, consent was sought again. We obtained a single document, in an open format, that accounted for the whole consent collection process: a time-stamped consent status regarding each version of the protocol. This document cannot be corrupted and can be checked on any dedicated public website. It should be considered a robust proof of data. However, in a live clinical trial, the authentication system should be strengthened to remove the need for third parties, here trial stakeholders, and give participative control to the peer users. In the future, the complex data flow of a clinical trial could be tracked by using Blockchain, which core functionality, named Smart Contract, could help prevent clinical trial events not occurring in the correct chronological order, for example including patients before they consented or analysing case report form data before freezing the database.

Significant concerns regarding data governance and security have reduced this sharing in practice. Blockchain could provide a secure method for sharing genomic data between involved parties and thus help overcome some of these issues. Objective: This study aims to contribute to the growing knowledge of the potential role of blockchain technology in supporting the sharing of clinical genomic data by describing blockchain-based dynamic consent architecture to support clinical genomic data sharing and provide a proof-of-concept implementation, called ConsentChain, for the architecture to explore its performance. Methods: The ConsentChain requirements were captured from a patient forum to identify security and consent concerns. The ConsentChain was developed on the Ethereum platform, in which smart contracts were used to model the actions of patients, who may provide or withdraw consent to share their data; the data creator, who collects and stores patient data; and the data requester, who needs to query and access the patient data. A detailed analysis was undertaken of the ConsentChain performance as a function of the number of transactions processed by the system. Results: We describe ConsentChain, a blockchain-based system that provides a web portal interface to support clinical genomic sharing. ConsentChain allows patients to grant or withdraw data requester access and allows data requesters to query and submit access to data stored in a secure off-chain database. We also developed an ontology model to represent patient consent elements into machine-readable codes to automate the consent and data access processes. Conclusions: Blockchains and smart contracts can provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support dynamic consent functionality and address some of the barriers that inhibit genomic data sharing. However, they are not a complete answer, and a number of issues still need to be addressed before such systems can be deployed in practice, particularly in relation to verifying user credentials. © Faisal Albalwy, Andrew Brass, Angela Davies.

To optimize medical services for individual patients, an open ecosystem for the healthcare industry that allows the exchange and utilization of personal health records (PHRs) is required. However, under the current system of hospital-centered data management, it is difficult to implement the linking and sharing of PHRs in practice. To address this problem, in this study, we present the design and implementation of a patient-centered PHR platform using blockchain technology. This platform achieved transparency and reliability in information management by eliminating the risk of leakage and tampering/altering personal information, which could occur when using a PHR. In addition, the patient-consent system was applied to a PHR; thus, the patient acted as the user with ownership. The proposed blockchain-based PHR platform enables the integration of personal medical information with scattered distribution across multiple hospitals, and allows patients to freely use their health records in their daily lives and emergencies. The proposed platform is expected to serve as a stepping stone for patient-centered healthcare data management and utilization. © 2021 KSII.",,,"Kim, Heongkyun (57429435200); Lee, Sangmin (57188673250); Kwon, Hyunwoo (57429610000); Kim, Eunmin (57429790300)",57429435200; 57188673250; 57429610000; 57429790300,KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems,,4400.0,4419.0,19.0,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123638269&doi=10.3837%2fTIIS.2021.12.008&partnerID=40&md5=1a11b617b49b27a0af51ee5441402d41,Blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric; On-Chain/Off-Chain; Patient Consent; Personal Health Record,Diagnosis; Distributed ledger; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Block-chain; Design and implementations; Disease prevention; Healthcare industry; Hyperledg fabric; Management systems; On-chain/off-chain; Paradigm shifts; Patient consent; Personal health record; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,2-s2.0-85123638269,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based data sharing scheme (BDSS) with fine-grained access control and permission revocation in this paper, which regards the medical environment as the application scenario. In this scheme, we separate the public part and private part of the electronic medical record (EMR). Then, we use symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) technology to encrypt these two parts separately, and use attribute-based encryption (ABE) technology to encrypt symmetric keys which used in SSE technology separately. This guarantees better fine-grained access control and makes patients to share data at ease. In addition, we design a mechanism for EMR permission grant and revocation so that hospital can verify attribute set to determine whether to grant and revoke access permission through blockchain, so it is no longer necessary for ciphertext re-encryption and key update. Finally, security analysis, security proof and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed scheme is safe and effective in practical applications.

It is especially applicable when the owner and manager of the object are inconsistent. With the development of the Internet of Things, there are more and more scenes where object owners and managers are inconsistent, but the research on permission delegation in access control based on blockchain is not perfect. Therefore, once implemented in these blockchain-based access control algorithms, the permission delegation tends to have an unauthorized access. Based on the analysis of the causes for the unauthorized access vulnerability, this paper proposes a token-constrained permission delegation algorithm (TCPDA), which converts the access control policy corresponding to permissions into constraints for permission use, embeds the constraints in the permission token, and forms constraints on the transfer of tokens. Only subjects that meet the constraint conditions can receive tokens, thereby solving unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation. Since not all access control models can transform strategies into constraints and integrate them into blockchain tokens, this paper also proposes a permission delegation algorithm for decision-making entities to make desirable decisions. Finally, the security analysis shows that the two proposed schemes can overcome the unauthorized access vulnerability caused by permission delegation, and the algorithm performance is analyzed through experiments. © 2013 IEEE.",,,"Shi, Jinshan (57197869661); Li, Ru (55491311600); Hou, Wenhan (57226371785)",57197869661; 55491311600; 57226371785,IEEE Access,9174726,156027.0,156042.0,15.0,10.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090950440&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3018783&partnerID=40&md5=e60ee0581a0630495bc888014cde7b56,Access control; blockchain; permission delegation; unauthorized access vulnerability,Blockchain; Decision making; Managers; Access control models; Access control policies; Algorithm performance; Constraint conditions; Decision-making entities; Security analysis; Unauthorized access; Access control,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85090950440,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, interoperability issues in the way health information exchanges are currently architected and differences in regulations across localities exacerbate the challenges of consent management. In this research, we survey potential patients' willingness to self-manage healthcare-related consent. Having established the desire for consent self-management, we propose a solution that enables the seamless sharing of patient consent across different healthcare providers and health information exchanges. Specifically, we use a rigorous design science approach to create a blockchain-based, self-managed patient consent system and we evaluate the design through an instantiated prototype. The results of our study should be useful to researchers in healthcare information management as well as to practitioners designing consent management systems. Our research contributes to design science research with an innovative, rigorously evaluated, design principles-based artifact that addresses a critical problem of sharing protected health information. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,,"Anderson, Chad (7404307339); Carvalho, Arthur (47861847800); Kaul, Mala (55710938700); Merhout, Jeffrey W.

This issue is particularly sensitive in applied medical fields where personal health information is handled within the network. In addition, contemporary blockchain‐converged solutions do not consider restricted medical data regulations that are still obstacles in many countries worldwide. This implies a crucial need for a system or solution that is suitable for the healthcare sector. Therefore, this article proposes the development of a dynamic consent medical blockchain system called DynamiChain, based on a ruleset management algorithm for handling health examination data. Moreover, medical blockchain‐related studies were systematically reviewed to prove the novelty of DynamiChain. The proposed system was implemented in a scenario where the exercise management healthcare company provided health management services based on data obtained from the data provider’s hospital.

Due to travel restrictions, safety concerns, and expensive travelling the younger generation is showing interest in virtual tourism instead of traditional tourism. However, virtual tourism does not financially benefit the service providers as compared to traditional tourism stakeholders. An online system is essential to provide a central point of access to various tourism sites along with usage, permission, and payment control. In this paper, a secure blockchain-based broker service for users and content providers is proposed, which allows tourism sites to announce their virtual tours and provide accessibility and accountability. Meanwhile, it enables users to register, subscribe, access, and be billed according to their usage. The permission control module ensures authentication and authorization, while the usage control provides accountability to the predefined service level agreement. The transactions are stored on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of data and smart contracts are used to ensure automatic usage and permission control.

This technology is now being implemented in various fields such as healthcare, IoT, data management, etc., apart from cryptocurrencies. As it is a newly emerging technology, researchers and organizations face many challenges in integrating this technology into other fields. Consent management is one of the essential processes in an organization because of the ever-evolving privacy laws, which are introduced to provide more control to users over their data. This paper is a systematic review of Blockchain’s application in the field of consent and privacy data management. The review discusses the adaptation of Blockchain in healthcare, IoT, identity management, and data storage.

GDPR recognizes user's consent as a legitimate ground for personal data processing in the context of online social networks. This article presents a comparative study about the criteria for valid consent under GDPR and existing consent seeking practices of OSNs. In order to simplify the comparative process, Facebook is taken as a case study for online social networks. In conclusion of the comparative study, we argue that existing consent mechanisms in OSNs are not GDPR compliant.

Actors who want to share data need systems to manage consent in order to decide who can access their data. This guarantees the privacy of data, which is often sensitive. As a secure distributed ledger, the blockchain is widely used today to manage consent for data access. However, a blockchain is not ideal for storing large volumes of data due to its characteristics. Therefore, it is often coupled with off-chain systems to facilitate the storage of these kinds of data. Therefore, data located outside the blockchain require security procedures. This article proposes a securing mechanism based on data encryption to secure data in off-chain storage in blockchain-based consent systems. The protocol uses a symmetric key system, which prevents the reading of data stored outside the sphere of the blockchain by malicious actors who would have access. The mechanism’s set up allows each set of data to be encrypted with a symmetric key that is anchored in a blockchain. This key is then used by the actors who have obtained the consent of the data owner to access and read the data stored outside the blockchain. © 2023 by the authors.",,,"Goint, Mongetro (57265260800); Bertelle, Cyrille (24279567300); Duvallet, Claude (13807954600)",57265260800; 24279567300; 13807954600,Mathematics,1592,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152800025&doi=10.3390%2fmath11071592&partnerID=40&md5=b26ff6557ee6f665b7a7927dc5b130e4,blockchain; data access; data encryption; distributed ledger; smart contracts,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85152800025,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can result in limited trust, transparency, and process inefficiencies, without true patient empowerment. The objective of this study was to determine whether blockchain technology could enforce trust, transparency, and patient empowerment in the clinical trial data management process, while reducing trial cost. Design: In this proof of concept pilot, we deployed a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain system in an active clinical trial setting to assess the impact of blockchain technology on mean monitoring visit time and cost, non-compliances, and user experience. Using a parallel study design, we compared differences between blockchain technology and standard methodology. Results: A total of 12 trial participants, seven study coordinators and three clinical research associates across five sites participated in the pilot. Blockchain technology significantly reduces total mean monitoring visit time and cost versus standard trial management (475 to 7 min; P = 0.001; €722 to €10; P = 0.001 per participant/visit, respectively), while enhancing patient trust, transparency, and empowerment in 91, 82 and 63% of the patients, respectively. No difference in non-compliances as a marker of trial quality was detected. Conclusion: Blockchain technology holds promise to improve patient-centricity and to reduce trial cost compared to conventional clinical trial management.

Permission delegation is an effective means to improve flexibility, but the delegated permission token in the current permission delegation scheme is a whole, and the recipient cannot re-delegate part of the permission in the received token. In this paper, a blockchain-based permission token segmentation scheme is proposed, which splits out part of the permissions in a permission token owned by the subject to generate a new token, so that the subject can control the fine-grained permissions in the token, enabling the subject to manage the permissions more flexibly. The permission combination scheme is then provided, and the permission invalidation problem in the token segmentation scheme is analyzed and discussed, and a token invalidation scheme is given. The security analysis shows that the scheme can reliably guarantee the security of authorized access. © 2020 IEEE.",,,"Shi, Jinshan (57197869661); Li, Ru (55491311600)",57197869661; 55491311600,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2020",9343075,1956.0,1964.0,8.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101211737&doi=10.1109%2fTrustCom50675.2020.00267&partnerID=40&md5=fadb0cb3a4eb32a6b0ef35b48bc8da5c,Access control; Blockchain; Internet of Things; Permission delegation; Token segmentation,Blockchain; Complex networks; Internet of things; Fine grained; Heterogeneous devices; Internet of thing (IOT); Security analysis; Segmentation scheme; Access control,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85101211737,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These strategies aim not only regional planning, but also economic development and people’s quality of life. This refers to the concept of smart territories. To achieve their objectives, smart territories generally use citizens’ data to offer them services and support them in better individualized decision-making. However, a major problem arises in data management, as it is necessary to have the consent of users to access and use data. In this article, we propose a generic blockchain-based model for consent-based data sharing in the context of smart territories, while putting users at the center of control of their data. We take advantage of ADA-M (Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix), a matrix that provides a standardized way to unambiguously represent conditions related to discovery and access to data. We couple the use of ADA-M with a blockchain anchor system, which helps secure consent management for data access. This helps to develop an environment of digital trust for sharing data between users. Then, through a digital token, we offer a system of rewards for users in cases where their data is used for commercial purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,"Goint, Mongetro (57265260800); Bertelle, Cyrille (24279567300); Duvallet, Claude (13807954600)",57265260800; 24279567300; 13807954600,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,,261.0,271.0,10.0,1.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115263025&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-86162-9_26&partnerID=40&md5=bad226e2744f190c70ce3b24e16db32b,,,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85115263025,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus.We believe that this focus on consensus protocols only explains part of the story. To investigate this belief, we raise a simple question: Can a well-crafted system using a classical consensus protocol outperform systems using modern protocols? In this tutorial, we answer this question by diving deep into the design of blockchain systems. Further, we take an in-depth look at the theory behind consensus, which can help users select the protocol that best-fits their requirements.

However, in fact, even the Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm cannot fundamentally guarantee that transaction information is real and legitimate in reality. Therefore, the normal operation of the blockchain system requires the establishment of a special supervisory body to audit the transaction information, which can ensure that the data sources are credible rather than spurious or illegal. In addition, in the environment of permissioned blockchain, the realization of access mechanism often relies on centralized certificate authority. Unfortunately, a highly centralized management entity is not entirely trustworthy and reliable because it may be corrupt or attacked, which inevitably triggers many information security incidents such as privacy leakage and data loss. In order to realize the secure governance of permissioned blockchain system, a novel multi-supervised permissioned blockchain (MSPB) model is proposed in this paper, which supports auditing and eliminates the centralized entities in the system, including certification authority and auditing authority.

In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based IoT systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location (PoL) on their actual locations.

A new block must wait for the completion of all previous blocks. 2) At the transaction level, the lack of efficient intra-block transactions concurrency makes it difficult to achieve high performance, especially when dealing with multiple CPU-heavy contracts which are commonly used in industrial scenarios.In this paper, we present FISCO-BCOS, an enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain system with high performance. To overcome serial limitations and fully utilize machine resources, FISCO-BCOS introduces Block Level Pipelining (BLP) workflow to process blocks in a pipeline manner. In addition, a scheduling algorithm Deterministic Multi-Contract (DMC) is designed to efficiently execute transactions in parallel. Under BLP and DMC, FISCO-BCOS achieves inter-block and intra-block paralleling to meet high-performance requirements in industrial application scenarios.

In this paper, we assess the communication overhead of running BA in an IoT environment that consists of wireless nodes (e.g., Raspberry PIs) with meshing capabilities. As the the packet loss ratio is significant and makes BA unfeasible to scale, we propose a network coding based approach that will reduce the packet overhead and minimize the consensus completion time of the BA. Specifically, various network coding approaches are designed as a replacement to TCP protocol which relies on unicasting and acknowledgements. The evaluation on a network of Raspberry PIs demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve scalability making BA feasible for medium size IoT networks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conference Paper,,2018.0,470–475,"New York, NY, USA","Proceedings of the 15th EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services","New York, NY, USA",2018,9781450360937.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3286978.3286984;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3286978.3286984,"Internet of Things (IoT), Communication Complexity, Information Spreading, Blockchain, Permissioned Blockchain",,MobiQuitous '18

Specifically, no distributed system can satisfy consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously. Informally, the innovative blockchain trilemma has been theorized to include security, scalability, and decentralization. While many software approaches on blockchains claim to solve the trilemma problem, almost all known approaches have been proven to involve trade-offs and fail to reach the upper bounds, meaning they do not achieve the theoretical limit value in each term of a trilemma. In this paper, we propose a general trilemma based on the above two. For permissioned blockchains, we then describe a system framework called GBT-CHAIN to solve the General Blockchain Trilemma. In the proposed framework, the consensus and data layer, the network layer and the physical layer work in cooperation. According to our theoretical proof and experimental analysis, the three properties of the trilemma consisting of consistency, scalability, and partition tolerance are perfectly satisfied without trade-offs.

We propose several optimizations for modular arithmetic (e.g., custom multipliers and fast modular reduction) and point arithmetic (e.g., reduced number of point double and addition operations, and optimal width NAF representation). Based on these optimized modular and point arithmetic modules, we propose an ECDSA verification engine that can be used by any application for fast verification of signatures. We further optimize our ECDSA verification engine for Hyperledger Fabric (one of the most widely used blockchain platforms) by moving carefully selected operations to a precomputation block, thus simplifying the critical path of ECDSA signature verification.

The main reason is that medical big data is difficult to achieve sharing. This paper studies and analyzes the problems of medical big data sharing, proposes a medical data sharing platform based on permissioned blockchains (BCs), which uses dual-BCs architecture (Account BC and transaction BC), Concurrent Byzantine Fault Tolerance (CBFT) consensus mechanism, encryption technology and smart contract technology. Account BC (ABC) is used to store user data hash after encryption and transaction BC (TBC) is used to process computing tasks. The use of encryption technology ensures that users have full autonomy in their own medical data. Smart contract technology is used to enable users to set up different access permissions of medical data. A TBC can be used by multiple ABCs and TBC does not save users' medical data, but only obtains users' medical data from ABCs when needs computation. When the computing task is completed, the TBC deletes all users' medical data and packages the operation record to save into ABCs, thereby it realizes data sharing while protecting users' privacy. In addition, this paper compares the functions with other medical data systems, analyzes and compares their advantages and disadvantages.

Namely, permissioned blockchains typically exhibit low latencies, compared to permissionless deployments—however at the cost of poor scalability. As a remedy, various solutions were proposed to capture “the best of both worlds”, targeting low latency and high scalability simultaneously. Among these, blockchain sharding emerges as the most prominent technique. Most existing sharding proposals exploit features of the permissionless model and are therefore restricted to cryptocurrency applications. A few permissioned sharding proposals exist, however, they either make strong trust assumptions on the number of faulty nodes or rely on trusted hardware or assume a static participation model where all nodes are expected to be available all the time. In practice, nodes may join and leave the system dynamically, which makes it challenging to establish how to shard and when. In this work, we address this problem and present Mitosis, a novel approach to practically improve scalability of permissioned blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of blockchains, as more participants join the system, to meet practical scalability requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing blockchain (and its participants) into two—reminiscent of mitosis, the biological process of cell division. Mitosis inherits the low latency of permissioned blockchains while preserving high throughput via parallel processing. Newly created chains in our system are fully autonomous, can choose their own consensus protocol, and yet they can interact with each other to share information and assets—meeting high levels of interoperability. We analyse the security of Mitosis and evaluate experimentally the performance of our solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that Mitosis can be ported with little modifications and manageable overhead to existing permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric.

This paper presents Qanaat, a scalable multi-enterprise permissioned blockchain system that guarantees the confidentiality of enterprises in collaboration workflows. Qanaat presents data collections that enable any subset of enterprises involved in a collaboration workflow to keep their collaboration private from other enterprises. A transaction ordering scheme is also presented to enforce only the necessary and sufficient constraints on transaction order to guarantee data consistency. Furthermore, Qanaat supports data consistency across collaboration workflows where an enterprise can participate in different collaboration workflows with different sets of enterprises. Finally, Qanaat presents a suite of consensus protocols to support intra-shard and cross-shard transactions within or across enterprises.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Journal Article,Proc.

Unfortunately, all existing permissioned blockchain frameworks adopt sequential workflows for invoking the consensus protocol and executing applications' transactions, making the performance of these applications much lower than deploying them in traditional systems (e.g., in-datacenter stock exchange).We propose Bidl, the first permissioned blockchain framework highly optimized for datacenter networks. We leverage the network ordering in such networks to create a shepherded parallel workflow, which carries a sequencer to parallelize the consensus protocol and transaction execution speculatively. However, the presence of malicious participants (e.g., a malicious sequencer) can easily perturb the parallel workflow to greatly degrade Bidl's performance. To achieve stable high performance, Bidl efficiently shepherds all participants by detecting their misbehaviors, and performs denylist-based view changes to replace or deny malicious participants. Compared with three fast permissioned blockchain frameworks, Bidl's parallel workflow reduces applications' latency by up to 72.7% and improves their throughput by up to 4.3x in the presence of malicious participants. Bidl is suitable to be integrated with traditional stock exchange systems.

It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require ""smart-contracts"" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conference Paper,,2018.0,,"New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the Thirteenth EuroSys Conference,"Porto, Portugal",2018,9781450355841.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190538;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3190508.3190538,,,EuroSys '18

However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Conference Paper,,2019.0,110–122,"New York, NY, USA",Proceedings of the 20th International Middleware Conference,"Davis, CA, USA",2019,9781450370097.0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3361525.3361540;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3361525.3361540,"Hyperledger Fabric, Eventual Consistency, CRDT, Multi-Version Concurrency Control, Blockchain",,Middleware '19
