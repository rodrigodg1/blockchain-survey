Blockchain is an enabling technology for building self-sovereign identity systems by providing a neutral and trustable storage and computing infrastructure, and can be viewed as a component of the systems. Both blockchain and self-sovereign identity are emerging technologies which could present a steep learning curve for architects. We collect and propose 12 design patterns for blockchain-based self-sovereign identity systems to help the architects understand and easily apply the concepts in system design. Based on the lifecycles of three main objects involved in self-sovereign identity, we categorise the patterns into three groups: key management patterns, decentralised identifier management patterns, and credential design patterns. The proposed patterns provide a systematic and holistic guide for architects to design the architecture of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity systems.","Pattern, Identity Management, Self-sovereign Identity, Blockchain, Architecture","EuroPLoP '20"

In particular, the paper provides an overview of the existing Sovrin self-sovereign identity on the Hyperledger Indy public permissioned blockchain as well as uPort and Jolocom on the Ethereum public permissionless blockchain. The paper then concludes with a discussion on the GDPR-compliance of the blockchain-based identity concepts.","GDPR, self-sovereign identity, data protection, DLT, blockchain","SAC '20"

Successful digital transformation requires confidence in and protection of digital identities. On the Internet, however, there is no unique and standard identity layer. Consequently, a variety of digital identities have emerged over years, leading to privacy risks, security vulnerabilities, risks for identity owners, and liability for identity issuers and those relying on digital identities to grant access to goods and services. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and similar forms of identity management on the blockchain distributed ledger are novel technologies that recognize the need to keep user identity privately stored in user-owned devices, securely verified by identity issuers, and only revealed to verifiers as needed. There is limited academic literature defining the prerequisite SSI functional and non-functional requirements and comparing SSI technologies. Often those SSI technologies reviewed in the literature lack behind current advances. We present the first work that compiles a comprehensive list of functional and non-functional requirements of SSI and compares an extensive number of existing SSI/blockchain-based identity management solutions with respect to these requirements. Our work sheds light on the state-of-the-art SSI development and paves the way for future, more informed analysis and development of novel identity management and SSI solutions.","privacy, blockchain, self-sovereign identity","WI-IAT '21"

Opportunities and Challenges of Self-Sovereign Identity Implementation in Public Administration: Lessons from the Belgian Case","2021","495–504","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","DG.O2021: The 22nd Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research","Omaha, NE, USA","2021","9781450384926","https://doi.org/10.1145/3463677.3463705;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3463677.3463705","10.1145/3463677.3463705","Self-sovereign identity (SS) has become a trend within the digital identity circles. This new paradigm places a user in the centre and allows them to have more control over their identity information. Such a concept has swiftly found its enthusiasts, who also actively experiment on SSI implementation in the public sector. Although SSI does not imply having any technology at the backbone, it is usually discussed in the blockchain context. This article explores what opportunities this new identity concept can bring to the public sector and the associated challenges in this process. Also, we seek to examine the dependency of SSI on blockchain technology. For this, we study the existing knowledge on SSI from the literature and interview industry experts to elucidate this phenomenon. Using the thematic analysis technique, we propose a framework for assessing the opportunities and challenges, using the case of Belgium as an example, showcasing the potential of SSI and what barriers it still needs to overcome. We conclude that although blockchain does contribute to achieving SSI, it is not the silver bullet for it.","blockchain, Self-sovereign identity, decentralised identity","DG.O'21"

The front-end of the DApp helps users generate transactions and send them to the user's blockchain wallet. After the user signs and confirms the transaction using the blockchain wallet, the transaction will invoke the smart contract of the DApp. However, users bear the following risks when using DApps because of the potential inconsistent behaviors in DApps. First, the DApp front-end may generate incorrect transactions inconsistent with users' intentions. Second, the smart contract may have misbehaviors when executing the transactions. Inconsistent behaviors of DApps not only lead to user confusion but also cause significant financial losses. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to identify inconsistent behaviors of DApps on EVM-compatible blockchains by contrasting the behaviors of DApps that derived from the front-end, blockchain wallet, and smart contracts, respectively. We implemented our approach into a prototype named DAppHunter. We have applied DAppHunter on 92 real-world DApps of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and successfully identified 37 DApps with inconsistent behaviors. We confirmed that 35 of them are scam DApps and over 5 million blockchain addresses are at risk of becoming victims of these inconsistent DApps.","DApp testing, smart contract, inconsistent behavior, blockchain","ICSE-SEIP '23"
