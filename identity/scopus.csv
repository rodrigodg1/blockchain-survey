The current identity management system is centralized and is controlled by a single entity. Users' privacy concerns are not in their best interest. Users have very little to no control over their data. The centralized system becomes a single point of failure which is prone to attack that leads to users losing their data privacy if these centralized systems are breached. Therefore we propose a Blockchain-based decentralized Identity Management System that makes use of self-sovereign identity, decentralized identifiers, and verifiable credentials. It also gives users the ability to choose from a very large number of identity providers instead of just a select few corporations. The main advantages of the proposed solution include the elimination of the need for a central authority for identity verification and identity data management, the reduction of time spent on identity verification, the ability to share data with permission, and the ability to verify the origin of the data while sharing. © 2022 IEEE.","","Authentication; Blockchain; Information management; 'current; Block-chain; Centralised; Centralized systems; Decentralised; Identity management; Identity management systems; Identity verification; Management IS; User identity; Data privacy","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152193057"

This creates a large context that implies a financial and identity data exchange paradigm, which faces challenges to balance customer experience, security, and the self-control over personal identity information. We propose Self-Sovereign Banking Identity (SSBI), a Blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) to secure private data sharing by utilizing trusted customer’s banking cards as a key storage and identity transaction-signing enclave. The design and implementation of the SSI framework is based on the Veramo SDK and Ethereum to overcome the limitation of signing curve availability on the current banking Java Cards needed for Hyperledger Indy. SSBI uses the elliptic curve SECP256K1 for transaction signing, which exists for several payment cards in the market. SSBI enables automated financial services and trust in the service provider communication. This work analyzes the flow and framework components, and evaluates the usability, integration, and performance in terms of throughput, latency, security, and complexity. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared with related solutions. The presented prototype implementation is based on a test Ethereum network and signing transactions on the banking card. The preliminary results show that SSBI provides an effective solution for integrating the customer’s banking cards to secure open banking identity exchange. Furthermore, it allows the integration of several scenarios to support trusted open banking. The Blockchain layer settings need to be scaled and improved before real-world implementation. © 2023 by the authors.","banking card; Blockchain; digital identity; open banking; self-sovereign identity","Digital storage; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document identification systems; Electronic money; Finance; Sales; Banking card; Block-chain; Customer experience; Digital identity; Identity information; Key storage; Open banking; Personal identity; Private data sharing; Self-sovereign identity; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163683012"

This solution brings together advances from the fields of identity management, confidential computing, and advanced data usage control. In the area of identity management, the solution is aligned with emerging decentralized identity standards: Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), DID communication and verifiable credentials (VCs). In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual's data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals. Specifically, our design covers necessary roles in the data-sharing ecosystem: The issuer of personal data, the individual holder of the personal data (i.e., the data subject), a trusted data storage manager, a trusted license distributor, and the data consumer. The proof-of-concept implementation utilizes the decentralized identity framework being developed by the Hyperledger Indy/Aries project.

We make the DID documents on the blockchain editable successfully and realize the update and revocation of DIDs. Then, we observe that DIURS can meet the structural stability and irreversibility requirements. The time of identity search and update is milliseconds. The length of the identity authentication path is short. There is no need to save the historical version of DID documents.

The design of threshold traceability of anonymous transactions allows network members to trace transactions back to the sender without violating the decentralized property of blockchain. In AttriChain, the spontaneous tracing of misbehaviors in the network distributes the power of identity governance to multiple independent tracing members instead of depending on single-point management.

As a result, linking or aggregating a complete record for a patient is a major technological, legal, and operational challenge. One of the factors that has made clinical data integration so difficult to achieve is the lack of a universal ID for everyone. This leads to other related problems of having to prove identity at each interaction with the health system and repeatedly providing basic information on demographics, insurance, payment, and medical conditions. Traditional solutions that require complex governance, expensive technology, and risks to privacy and security of the data have failed adequately to solve this interoperability problem. We describe the technical design decisions of a patient-centric decentralized health identity management system using the blockchain technology, called MediLinker, to address some of these challenges. Design: Our multidisciplinary research group developed and implemented an identity wallet, which uses the blockchain technology to manage verifiable credentials issued by healthcare clinics, banks, and insurance com-panies. To manage patient’s self-sovereign identity, we leveraged the Hyperledger Indy blockchain framework to store patient’s decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the schemas or format for each credential type. In con-trast, the credentials containing patient data are stored ‘off-ledger’ in each person’s wallet and accessible via a computer or smartphone. We used Hyperledger Aries as a middleware layer (API: Application Programming Interface) to connect Hyperledger Indy with the front-end, which was developed using a JavaScript frame-work, ReactJS (Web Application) and React Native (iOS Application). Results: MediLinker allows users to store their personal data on digital wallets, which they control. It uses a decentralized trusted identity using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. Patients use MediLinker to register and share their information securely and in a trusted system with healthcare and other service provid-ers. Each MediLinker wallet can have six credential types: health ID with patient demographics, insurance, medication list including COVID-19 vaccination status, credit card, medical power of attorney (MPOA) for guardians of pediatric or geriatric patients, and research consent. The system allows for in-person and remote granting and revoking of such permissions for care, research, or other purposes without repeatedly requiring physical identity documents or enrollment information. Conclusion: We successfully developed and tested a blockchain-based technical architecture, described in this article, as an identity management system that may be operationalized and scaled for future implementation to improve patient experience and control over their personal information. © 2022, Partners in Digital Health.

SSI allows the owner to have sovereignty over their identity information. Currently, blockchain technology is widely used to implement SSI management system. Issuing a verifiable credential (VC) based on blockchain has two advantages: it ensures the VC has not been tampered with and makes the VC trustworthy by sharing the same ledger among untrusted parties. This paper presents a SSI management system which was designed and implemented for police or firefighters who still manage identity information centrally. Furthermore, given the inherent risks associated with these occupations, it is imperative to have a secure healthcare system to meet their specific needs. We propose a system that links these healthcare systems, allowing owners of identity information to monitor how their identity information has been used.

The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a new class of user-controlled resilient identity management systems that are enabled by distributed ledger technology. This paper examines how SSI management can be used in a public transportation sector that spans different operators in multiple countries. Specifically, the paper explores how a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system can draw on the SSI framework to provide high-level security and transparency for all involved parties in public transportation ecosystems. Accordingly, building on analyses of the existing public transportation ticketing solutions, we elicited requirements of a comparable system based on the SSI principles. Next, we developed a low-fidelity prototype to showcase how passengers can utilize standardized travel credentials that are valid across different transportation networks in Europe.

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a technology to solve cross-domain authentication. However, there are problems such as difficulty in mutual trust between multiple certificate authority nodes (CA), failure of single point, and low efficiency in the traditional PKI method. Blockchain is a promising technology for decentralized trust management by providing consistent data storage, which gives impetus to the further development of cross-domain identity authentication. Thus, this article apply blockchain to cross-domain identity authentication. To solve the defects of the traditional PKI method, the design requirements are analyzed firstly, based on the analysis result, we proposed a double-layer cross-domain identity authentication model by constructing a consortium blockchain which is comprised of authentication server nodes (AS) and some internal blockchain, the model can highly improve the scalability of the PKI system without changing the internal architecture. Then a novel authentication protocol was put forward. The protocol can improve the efficiency of online cross-domain identity authentication transactions by verifying the hash instead of the signature of their certificate. By putting the generation process of the blockchain certificate and the storage process of its hash in the registration operation and reducing the authentication process for AS and CA, the efficiency is further improved. Finally, the protocol was evaluated by security and performance analysis. The results display our protocol can guarantee security and has an excellent performance in cross-domain identity authentication transactions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","Authentication; Digital storage; Efficiency; Information management; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Authentication servers; Block-chain; Certificate authority; Cross-domain; Decentralised; Identity authentication; Identity authentication protocol; Protocol cans; Public key infrastructure; Server nodes; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117383825"

Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) has been proposed as the next generation paradigm for decentralised identity management. Research on SSI is getting more and more traction, focusing mainly on the management of users’ identifiers and on providing a standard way to express and verify credentials. Instead, this paper focuses on the understanding of the role of trust in SSI and it provides new insight into the trust relationships existing between the different SSI actors. Indeed, the analysis of such roles and the relationships existing between SSI actors reveals that the current paradigm suffers from trust issues between the verifier and the issuer of a verifiable credential. In order to cope this problem, the paper proposes a new multi-layer framework that exploits trust relationships defined by the actors of the SSI standards (verifiers and issuers of verifiable credentials). An implementation of the framework through Solidity smart contracts has been proposed and deployed on both private and public blockchain networks in order to assess its capabilities. In addition, a dataset related to the spread of spam reviews has been exploited to test the benefits and performance of the proposed framework, demonstrating that it is able to improve the reliability of the SSI paradigm in real-world scenario. © 2023 The Author(s)","Distributed Ledger Technology; Self Sovereign Identity; Trust Management System; Web of Trust","Distributed ledger; Smart contract; Statistical tests; Block-chain; Decentralisation; Decentralized system; Distributed ledg technology; Multi-layers; Self sovereign identity; Trust frameworks; Trust management systems; Trust relationship; Web of trust; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167990287"

Also, they have to share their personal information credulously to verify their certificates to the hospital they are intended to do medical practices, or to the medical college to pursue higher degrees which are not secure enough as there lies the biggest threat of misusing their personal information. To overcome these two major problems, a system is required that will authenticate a healthcare professional’s digital credentials with minimal identity reveal.

It is often suggested that blockchain enables the decentralised and trusted ecosystem required for an SSI system. We evaluate whether blockchain can provide the necessary decentralisation and trust. We argue that blockchain has the potential to enable this ecosystem, but this is dependent on the type of blockchain used to implement an SSI system. Moreover, with respect to trust, we argue that blockchain alone is not sufficient and must be accompanied with other mechanisms to provide a trusted ecosystem for SSI systems. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

A secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient identity solution is essential but challenging. This paper examines the current literature and provides a systematic literature review in three stages based on the three research questions (RQ) that show the assessment and interpretation process step by step. Based on the parameters and RQ specified in the research methodology section, a total of 43 primary articles have been selected from the 251 articles extracted from various scientific databases. The majority of these articles are concerned with evaluating the existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions and their role in the blockchain-based land registry system to address the compliance issues in the existing SSI solutions with SSI principles and find the best possible SSI solution to address the identity problems in the land registry. The existing digital identity solutions cannot handle the requirements of the identity principle and are prone to various limitations like centralization and dependency on third parties that further augment the chance of security threats. SSI has been designed to overcome these limitations and provide a secure, reliable, and efficient identity solution that gives complete control to the users over their personal identity information (PII). This paper reviews the existing SSI solutions, evaluates them based on the SSI principles, and comes up with the best possible SSI solution for a blockchain-based land registry system. It further provides a detailed investigation of each SSI solution to present its functionalities and limitations for further improvement.  © 2022 Mohammed Shuaib et al.","","Electronic document identification systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Block-chain; Digital identity; Land registries; Privacy preserving; Process steps; Research methodologies; Research questions; Scientific database; Systematic literature review; Blockchain","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128769755"

In this series, a recently emerging IDM system is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) which offers greater control and access to users regarding their identity. This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efficiency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system. Secondly, it develops a Decentralized Application (DApp) to demonstrate and evaluate its operational services and efficiency.

Authentication systems mostly assume the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in the form of a Certificate Authority (CA) or as an authentication server. However, relying on a TTP implies that users do not directly manage their identities, but delegate this role to a third party. This intrinsic issue can generate trust concerns (e.g., identity theft), as well as privacy concerns towards the third party. The main objective of this research is to present an autonomous and independent solution where users can store their self created credentials without depending on TTPs. To this aim, the use of an TTP autonomous and independent network is needed, where users can manage and assess their identities themselves. In this paper, we propose the framework called Three Blockchains Identity Management with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (3BI-ECC). With our proposed framework, the users' identities are self-generated and validated by their owners. Moreover, it allows the users to customize the information they want to share with third parties. © 2021 IEEE.","blockchain; certificate; cybersecurity; ECC; identities; self-generated identity","Authentication; Public key cryptography; Authentication servers; Authentication systems; Certificate authority; Elliptic curve cryptography; Identity management; Identity theft; Privacy concerns; Trusted third parties; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107350173"

The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth application’s domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner. We implemented smart contracts on an Ethereum consortium blockchain to facilities identification and authentication procedures. We further analyze the performance using different metrics, including transaction gas cost, transaction per second, number of blocks lost, and block propagation time. Parameters including block-time, gas-limit, and sealers are adjusted to achieve the optimal performance of our consortium blockchain. © 2021 by the authors.

With this rapid expansion, it faces some major hurdles in data secrecy, privacy, and device integrity, and perhaps, in general, digital identity has been a major problem on the internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided a standardized format through which one can specify his identity called Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs). Blockchain technology, alongside decentralized identifiers and public-key cryptography, offers a peer-to-peer identity and credential management model through self-sovereign identity. Combining the decentralized identity and blockchains provides us with verifiable credentials through which one can verify the identities of transacting peers by decentralized registration and discovery of public keys needed to verify digital signatures. This combined framework is trusted, permissioned, supports device registration and verification along with revocation of device credentials, is secure, respects the privacy of the participating nodes, and maintains the integrity of their data. With several new communication protocols being developed for IoT and leveraging the Blockchain protocols in the domain of IoT, this paper quantitatively compares the performance of the well-known IoT communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and DIDComm in real-time testbed on various parameters, and the results are tabulated.

The DIDSB framework classifies entities into three distinct categories, namely identity providers, service providers, and end-users. The efficacy of the system in identifying and extracting fields from identification cards is attributed to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Subsequently, the system dissects the fields into smaller constituents to facilitate optical character recognition (OCR) and user authentication. The utilisation of the zero-knowledge proof concept by DIDSB enables secure authentication with service providers. This obviates the necessity of divulging any personal data while undergoing the authentication procedure. This advanced system empowers users to exercise authority over their confidential information while simultaneously safeguarding it with optimal efficacy and security. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the system exhibits a proficient ability to combat identity fraud, while concurrently preserving the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.","","Authentication; Decentralized systems; Electronic document identification systems; Optical character recognition; Sensitive data; Block-chain; Decentralized system; Digital identity; Digital identity management; End-users; Identity management; Identity protection; Identity providers; Novel solutions; Service provider; Blockchain","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175201896"

Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods: We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results: A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions: This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE. © 2023 The Authors","Blockchain; Health information exchange; Non-fungible token; Patient tokenization; Self-sovereign identity; Smart contract","Blockchain; Computer Security; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Architecture; Blockchain; Health care; Health risks; Information dissemination; Block-chain; Case-studies; Decentralised; Health information exchange; Health informations; Information exchanges; Non-fungible token; Patient tokenization; Self-sovereign identity; Tokenization; adult; article; blockchain; feasibility study; health care personnel; human; medical information system; running; validation process; computer security; Smart contract","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150463220"

Solutions for health data management, as in storing it, sharing and processing it, are emerging quickly and were significantly boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic that created a need to move things online. EHRs make a crucial part of digital identity data, and the same digital identity trends - as in self-sovereign identity powered by decentralized ledger technologies like blockchain, are being researched or implemented in contexts managing digital interactions between health facilities, patients, and health professionals. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution enabling secure exchange of EHRs between different parties powered by a self-sovereign identity (SSI) wallet and decentralized identifiers. We also make use of a consortium IPFS network for off-chain storage and attribute-based encryption (ABE) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Through our solution, we grant users full control over their medical data and enable them to securely share it in total confidentiality over secure communication channels between user wallets using encryption. We also use DIDs for better user privacy and limit any possible correlations or identification by using pairwise DIDs. Overall, combining this set of technologies guarantees secure exchange of EHRs, secure storage, and management along with by-design features inherited from the technological stack.  © 2023 Marie Tcholakian et al.","","Cryptography; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Information management; Block-chain; Classifieds; Content-based access; Decentralised; Digital identity; Electronic health; Health records; Medical data; Medical record; Privacy law; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160640469"

Dynamic passwords Although authentication is more secure, if there is a problem with the time synchronization between the server and the client, the user will not be able to login for a long time. Moreover, the password of the dynamic password is the same within a period of time, and it is also vulnerable to replay attacks. Therefore, a decentralized dynamic identity authentication system based on blockchain isn't proposed.

As a result, SCM promoted the problem of “orphans’ works” and facilitated the processing of rights, and revealed that it could contribute to the further development of culture.

This research explains how technological, organisational and environmental (TOE) factors affect organisations’ adoption behaviour toward BDIDM. This study aims to determine the most critical factors affecting the behaviour while assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the model involved, i.e., TOE-BDIDM. Online questionnaires are used to survey 111 information and cybersecurity practitioners within South African organisations. The analysis combines binary logistic regression modelling, Structural Equation Modelling of the measurement model, and chi-squared tests. The results suggest TOE factors positively or negatively affect adoption behaviour. The behaviour is significantly affected by technology characteristics, i.e., BDIDM’s disruptive nature, and is associated with Blockchain type. Indeed, the majority of participants intended to recommend BDIDM to their organisations yet paradoxically preferred private-permissioned blockchain the most, revealing resistance to decentralised and privacy-preserving BDIDM models like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The latter might be utopian or unsustainable for organisations. TOE-BDIDM was found relatively appropriate and effective but arguably ‘incomplete’ for explaining the adoption of disruptive technologies like SSI in organisations.

This new paradigm places a user in the centre and allows them to have more control over their identity information. Such a concept has swiftly found its enthusiasts, who also actively experiment on SSI implementation in the public sector. Although SSI does not imply having any technology at the backbone, it is usually discussed in the blockchain context. This article explores what opportunities this new identity concept can bring to the public sector and the associated challenges in this process. Also, we seek to examine the dependency of SSI on blockchain technology. For this, we study the existing knowledge on SSI from the literature and interview industry experts to elucidate this phenomenon. Using the thematic analysis technique, we propose a framework for assessing the opportunities and challenges, using the case of Belgium as an example, showcasing the potential of SSI and what barriers it still needs to overcome. We conclude that although blockchain does contribute to achieving SSI, it is not the silver bullet for it. © 2021 ACM.","blockchain; decentralised identity; Self-sovereign identity","Blockchain; Electronic document identification systems; Belgium; Digital identity; Identity information; Industry experts; Public sector; Thematic analysis; Public administration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108143605"

However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Authentication; Blockchain; Security; VoIP","Blockchain; Cost effectiveness; Cryptography; Data privacy; Fault tolerance; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Network architecture; Peer to peer networks; Secure communication; Time delay; Voice/data communication systems; Authentication mechanisms; Block-chain; Call process; Decentralised; Identity authentication; Integrity authentications; Non repudiation; Security; Voice over IP; VoIP; Authentication","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144551871"

The proposed scheme makes use of a combination of biometric traits and other identity attributes that could vary or evolve over time.

As with any type of identity, self-sovereign identities too deal with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the identity holders and comes with the usual risks of privacy and security. This study examined certain scenarios of personal data disclosure via credential exchanges between such identities and risks of man-in-the-middle attacks in the blockchain based identity system Hyperledger Indy.

Contrary to conventional blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, many SSI systems do not capture on ledger the exchange of transactional data between individuals. By not capturing the exchange of transaction data such SSI systems have the advantage of complying with privacy regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations, but, at the same time, have the disadvantage of not capturing evidence that an exchange has happened. Such evidence, however, may be needed for audit and accountability purposes. To achieve these objectives and to preserve privacy, we leverage archival principles to introduce a novel concept of a proof registry, which we define as a set of technical components, data structures, and process flows, that assures that authoritative records offering evidence of transactions is captured, stored, and accessible. This solution solves the compliance and accountability problem while preserving the self-sovereignty and privacy of involved parties. © 2021 IEEE.","","Application programs; Privacy by design; General data protection regulations; Novel concept; Privacy regulation; Process flows; Transaction data; Transactional data; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115861569"

Data manipulation and tampering of emissions values due to the economic incentives and environmental and health issues require a tamper-proof solution with the use of blockchain (BC) where the integrity of data is ensured. In this paper, we propose the integration of a public permissioned Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) framework with a permissioned consortium BC based architecture. This innovatively supports the decentralization of the authentication and authorization processes to overcome the single point of failure problems and the use of SSI to assign identities to IoT devices. Additionally, it gives full control to the holders for their identities, whether they are humans, organizations or smart vehicles. With the practice of advanced zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptographic techniques, the exposure of sensitive and private information is minimized to the absolute necessary and gains in performance and scalability are achieved.

With these systems, customers could withdraw money and make payments without visiting a bank. However, traditional ATM, debit and credit card systems inherit several weaknesses such as limited ATM facilities in rural areas, the high initial cost of ATM deployment, potential security issues in ATM systems, high inter-bank transaction fees etc. Through this research, we propose a blockchain-based peer-to-peer money transfer system “Promize” to address these limitations. The Promize platform provides a blockchain-based, low cost, peer-to-peer money transfer system as an alternative for traditional ATM system and debit/credit card system. Promize provides a self-sovereign identity empowered mobile wallet for its end users. With this, users can withdraw money from registered banking authorities (e.g. shops, outlets etc.) or their friends without going to an ATM. Any user in the Promize platform can act as an ATM, which is introduced as a mobile ATM. The Promize platform provides blockchain-based low-cost inter-bank transaction processing, thereby reducing the high inter-bank transaction fee. The Promize platform guarantees data privacy, confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, authenticity and availability when conducting electronic transactions using the blockchain. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Electronic payments; Self-sovereign identity; Smart contract","Costs; Data privacy; Electronic money; Internet protocols; Peer to peer networks; ATM debit card; ATM systems; Bank transactions; Block-chain; Cloud-computing; Credit cards; Electronic payment; Money transfers; Peer to peer; Self-sovereign identity; Smart contract","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130715418"

This requires counterparty networks to know the identities and certification chains of each other's members, establishing a common trust basis rooted in identity. But permissioned networks are ad hoc consortia of existing organizations, whose network affiliations may not be well-known or well-established even though their individual identities are. In this paper, we describe an architecture and set of protocols for distributed identity management across permissioned blockchain networks to establish a trust basis for data sharing. Networks wishing to interoperate can associate with one or more distributed identity registries that maintain credentials on shared ledgers managed by groups of reputed identity providers. A network's participants possess self-sovereign decentralized identities (DIDs) on these registries and can obtain privacy-preserving verifiable membership credentials. During interoperation, networks can securely and dynamically discover each others' latest membership lists and members' credentials. We implement a solution based on Hyperledger Indy and Aries, and demonstrate its viability and usefulness by linking a trade finance network with a trade logistics network, both built on Hyperledger Fabric. We also analyze the extensibility, security, and trustworthiness of our system.  © 2021 IEEE.","Blockchain; Decentralized Identity; Distributed Ledgers; Interoperability; Security","Blockchain; Chromium compounds; Cryptocurrency; Data Sharing; Network architecture; Network security; Privacy by design; Cross networks; Distributed identity management; Identity management; Identity providers; Interoperations; Logistics network; Privacy preserving; Information management","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114495118"

In essence, multi-party agreement signing (MPAS) can be reckoned as a special case of the multi-party fair exchange (MPFE) for signatures over a digital agreement. However, such general MPAS protocols have not seen wide adoptions in practice, possibly due to the lack of incentives to maintain the signing platform. Practically, monetary-incentivized enterprises exist to act as a trusted third party (TTP) and provide signing services. However, such an agreement signing flow still suffers from certain limitations in terms of insecure and inefficient operations. To this end, we propose a secure and efficient framework for multi-party agreement signing based on decentralized identity, blockchain and decentralized storage network (DSN). The framework consists of two subsystems where the identity subsystem contains an extensible three-tier user identity model atop decentralized identity, and the agreement signing subsystem, empowered by the identity subsystem, DSN and several novel designs, achieves security and efficiency design goals. For the convenience of explanation, we suppose that a centralized signing service provider (SSP) is properly involved, i.e., sensitive information is still protected against the SSP, and acts as a TTP to ensure the crucial properties such as fairness and coordinate the signing activities. Our design is also compatible with other methods, e.g., ensuring fairness via blockchain, which removes the single point of failure of SSP. We prototype the framework and the performance evaluation shows effectiveness and efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Agreement signing; Blockchain; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage networks; Self-sovereign identity","Efficiency; Network security; Agreement signing; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage network; Self-sovereign identity; Service provider; Storage networks; Trusted third parties; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145258099"

People have a plethora of digital data points to denote them in digital world. Digital personal data points, also known as Digital Identity, contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) which is private to every individual. Managing the cycle of private, high security data from its creation till verification is a massive undertaking. As there are instances where personal data are breached, centralized servers fail to respond, attacks compromise the entire system, it becomes difficult to rely on such systems. Blockchain is a propitious technology that is immutable, decentralized, tamper-proof, highly secure and easy to use. This paper proposes to use Blockchain and leverage its advantages to establish a self-sovereign digital identity management system, collision resistant encrypted document, which ensures the integrity of document issued. It presents DigiBlock as a powerful solution to the current scenario with a robust role based permission system leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which provides advantage over centralized system with its exceptional sovereignty, storage-control, cost-free, security, privacy, transparency and portability features.  © 2022 IEEE.","Authentication; Blockchain Technology; Distributed Ledger Technology; Identity Management; Security; Self-sovereign Identity","Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Distributed ledger; Electronic document identification systems; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Datapoints; Digital datas; Digital era; Digital world; Distributed ledg technology; Identity management; Security; Self-sovereign identity; Authentication","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154590117"

Some of these efforts involve appropriate social distancing in public places, monitoring and tracking temperature at the point of access, etc. In order for us to get back to the “new normal"", there is a need for automated and efficient human contact tracing that would be non-intrusive and effective in containing the spread of the virus. In this paper, we have developed “Connect"", a Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based digital contact tracing platform. “Connect"" will provide an automated mechanism to notify people in their immediate proximity of an occurrence of a positive case and would reduce the rate at which the infection could spread. The platform’s self-sovereign identity capability will ensure no attribution to a user and the user will be empowered to share information. The ability to notify in a privacy-preserving fashion would provide businesses to put in place dynamic and localized data-driven mitigation response. “Connect’s"" SSI based identity wallet platform encodes user’s digital identities and activity trace data on a permissioned blockchain platform and verified using SSI proofs. The user activities will provide information, such as places travelled, travel and dispatch updates from the airport etc. The activity trace records can be leveraged to identify suspected patients and notify the local community in real-time.

However, as the continuous development of smart tourism industry, various types of dishonest even illegal behavior have gradually emerged. Due to the absence of an effective identity authentication mechanism for the travel services provider, there are illegal travel agencies, unqualified part-time tour guides, etc., thereby harming the rights and interests of tourist. Considering the above problems, this paper proposes a smart tourism identity authentication service based on blockchain and Decentralized Identifier (DID). The service requester can verify the attributes of the DID, and then check the certificate. By exploiting the collaborative management of on-chain and off-chain data, the entire process of smart tourism service identity authentication is safe, reliable and traceable. In order to alleviate the storage pressure of blockchain, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is introduced to store DID document and Verifiable Credential certificate.

There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; Identity; identity management system; self-sovereign identity","Authentication; Life cycle; Identity management systems; Influential effects; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078548959"

In the proposed platform, the DID and a credential represent an user's digital identity. We define DID chaincode and credential protocol to cover the full lifecycle of a user's digital identity. We build a complete consortium blockchain and application environment, and implement a prototype as an App for Android-based phones.

With these systems, customers could withdraw money and make payments without visiting a bank. However, traditional ATM, debit and credit card systems inherit several weaknesses such as limited ATM facilities in rural areas, the high initial cost of ATM deployment, potential security issues in ATM systems, high inter-bank transaction fees etc. Through this research, we propose a blockchain-based peer-to-peer money transfer system “Promize” to address these limitations. The Promize platform provides a blockchain-based, low cost, peer-to-peer money transfer system as an alternative for traditional ATM system and debit/credit card system. Promize provides a self-sovereign identity empowered mobile wallet for its end users. With this, users can withdraw money from registered banking authorities (e.g. shops, outlets etc.) or their friends without going to an ATM. Any user in the Promize platform can act as an ATM, which is introduced as a mobile ATM. The Promize platform provides blockchain-based low-cost inter-bank transaction processing, thereby reducing the high inter-bank transaction fee. The Promize platform guarantees data privacy, confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, authenticity and availability when conducting electronic transactions using the blockchain. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Cloud computing; Electronic payments; Self-sovereign identity; Smart contract","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112688929"

Adopting the SSI approach prevents users to have a distinct identity for each service they use, instead, use a unique decentralised identity for all the services they need to access. However, to really benefit from the SSI advantages, an actual decentralised implementation is needed to fit the specific requirements and limits of decentralised architectures, such as blockchain. To this aim, this paper proposes Algorand Identity (AlgoID), a new SSI framework for the Algorand blockchain which differs from the already existing one, because it is fully blockchain based, i.e., it exploits Algorand itself for the storage of the data identity and as the registry location. The proposed framework has been completely implemented and validated through experiments, showing that the time required to execute the framework operations is acceptably low in realistic use cases. © 2023 IEEE.","Algorand; Blockchain; Digital Identity; Self Sovereign Identity; Smart Contract","Blockchain; Digital storage; Electronic document identification systems; Algorand; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized architecture; Digital identity; Self sovereign identity; Smart contract","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171979238"

In this paper, a blockchain (BCN)-based SSI system has been developed as a new identity plane to enable routing device owners in Autonomous Systems (ASs) to have greater control over inter-domain networks (IDNs), potentially across multiple paths that comply with routing device-defined preferences. The proposed system provides identity management, authentication and transparent information about routers, attested by ASs, while maintaining the privacy of sensitive network details. Device-level information and preferences are protected by BCN-based SSI. We used a GNS3 network emulation test bed and Hyperledger Indy distributed identity management system to test the proposed solution's AS convergence time and credential operation time respectively. Experiment results demonstrated that when the proposed routing system was used in combination with the BCNbased SSI credential management platform, the convergence time for the Inter-AS and Intra-AS systems became longer as the number of routers increased, whereas the credential operations had shorter processing times.

Currently, due to the dominance of large internet companies/cloud service providers, the control over the identity is not with the identity holder, leading to privacy concerns. The need for decentralization of identity is because it gives back control of identity credentials to identity holders and allows them to control when, how, and with whom to share their credentials. Self-sovereign Identity is an arising concept, which provides a way for digital identification. It enables the entities to control their identity and data flow in the digital world while enhancing privacy and security. Major privacy concerns are because of the numerous attacks and data breaches that can happen when sensitive information like identity credentials is stored on a centralized system used by the existing systems. Therefore, we propose a blockchain based self-sovereign identity platform where the user's mobile wallet application.

Self-sovereign identity is a new approach in identity management where entities have control of their digital identity. The emerging blockchain technology enables self-sovereign identity management, a decentralized identity management model that eliminates identity providers as a trusted third party. Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain network, this new paradigm of identity management demands different trust requirements. This research provides the first thorough review in literature addressing trust management for blockchain-based self-sovereign identity. A formal and comprehensive trust model proposed for blockchain-based Self-Sovereign IDM will be explored. Besides reviewing trust requirements, the paper also surveys the state-of-the-art of blockchain technology for self-sovereignty in identity management. This survey provides a critical analysis for existing research which sheds light on various opportunities for enhancing security and privacy of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity management and the improvement of trust management.

There is a challenge of how to verify users' identities and ensure the endorsements' realities on Blockchain. The decentralized public key infrastructure running on Blockchain can solve the above problems to some extent, but we can provide an identity-model closer to the real society with the combination of the attribute-based algorithm and Blockchain. This paper proposes an access control scheme based on Blockchain and decentralized the attribute-based algorithm with the identity. It uses mutual authorization between users and organizations to get endorsements of identity's attributes for trust-cost links, and uses the attribute-based algorithm to control and share data on the chain for fine-grained access control and privacy protection. By designing a multi-user collaborative attribute-based algorithm, it offers endorsement capabilities for organizations in the identity-model. Through experimental simulation and comparative analysis, the solution meets the requirements of the current universal Blockchain in terms of security and performance, and provides a universal identity-model. © 2021, Science China Press.

Successful digital transformation requires confidence in and protection of digital identities. On the Internet, however, there is no unique and standard identity layer. Consequently, a variety of digital identities have emerged over years, leading to privacy risks, security vulnerabilities, risks for identity owners, and liability for identity issuers and those relying on digital identities to grant access to goods and services. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and similar forms of identity management on the blockchain distributed ledger are novel technologies that recognize the need to keep user identity privately stored in user-owned devices, securely verified by identity issuers, and only revealed to verifiers as needed. There is limited academic literature defining the prerequisite SSI functional and non-functional requirements and comparing SSI technologies. Often those SSI technologies reviewed in the literature lack behind current advances. We present the first work that compiles a comprehensive list of functional and non-functional requirements of SSI and compares an extensive number of existing SSI/blockchain-based identity management solutions with respect to these requirements. Our work sheds light on the state-of-the-art SSI development and paves the way for future, more informed analysis and development of novel identity management and SSI solutions.  © 2021 ACM.","blockchain; privacy; self-sovereign identity","Distributed ledger; Block-chain; Case-studies; Comparatives studies; Digital identity; Digital transformation; Identity management; Non-functional requirements; Privacy; Privacy risks; Self-sovereign identity; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128677599"

The application will serve as an interface to all the entities involved, viz. user, authority, and verifier. The use of blockchain is to dodge the centralized identity manager. The user gets digital identity after getting authority’s verifiable claim and the identity is stored on interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the content address of these is stored on the blockchain. This makes it easy for the user to interact with different services without having identity for each one of them. The security of user data is ensured by encrypting the data and giving user the complete control over his data stored in the IPFS. The blockchain cannot extract the user’s data but can only request the user to provide some data attribute or some verification as the verifier demands. Thus, the system provides security and privacy to users’ data as well as user has control over his data. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital identity; Privacy; Security","Authentication; Blockchain; Data privacy; Electronic document identification systems; Block-chain; Centralised; Current technology; Digital identity; Filesystem; Identity management systems; New applications; Privacy; Security; User data; Cryptography","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116871259"

The proof of these identities is stored in the blockchain-based decentralized storage as a self-sovereign identity proof. Casper platforms' Self-Sovereign Identity(SSI)-based system provides a Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP) mechanism to verify the identity information. Casper platform can be adopted in various domains such as healthcare, banking, government organization etc. As a use case, we have discussed building a digital identity wallet for banking customers with the Casper platform.

As these data need to be validated to be trusted, they may become a more important data source for digital information sharing and transactions than the formal source of identity controlled by governments. Furthermore, SSIs can be used for interacting digitally with any organization. These developments change the relationship between government, companies, and individuals. We explore information sharing and governance in the digital society using blockchain-based SSIs. In addition, the impact of SSIs on data storage in the digital world is assessed.

As public online presence grows and transactions take place around the world, it becomes important to identify and validate digital identities. In addition, larger organizations are collecting more and more personally identifiable information, leaving databases open to malicious intruders and untrusted individuals. The scenario of identity management is now changing with decentralized identity management solutions using blockchain technology which place the complete control of the user’s data with him/herself. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) management is a popular application for blockchain technology. During the six months that this investigation was conducted, several major attacks were carried out against companies that process large amounts of personal data. Equifax has lost over 140 million customer records, including blockchain identity management, digital identities, and self-governed identities. The SSI as a novelty in the identity management landscape is made possible with blockchain. It has been created for the ease of use, and anyone can understand and use the concept of self-sovereign identity. SSI can solve a variety of issues such as privacy, scalability, flexibility, proximity, and consent. This research paper attempts to answer the following research question. Is blockchain useful in IAM with SSI? The authors seek the answer in a survey of some key enabling technologies including IAM’s security, prevention, digital identity, decentralization, and blockchain technologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Blockchain; Decentralized ledger; Identity and access management; Self-sovereign identity","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142737773"

This presents several security concerns as a CA is a single point of failure in the system. Besides, managing public keys by a centralized CA is becoming costly regarding the current growth in users and the distributed systems they use. Also, centralized identity management systems lack interoperability and present privacy concerns. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems aim to address these issues by providing decentralized identity ecosystems that facilitate the registration and exchange of identity attributes, and the propagation of trust between participating entities, without needing to rely on a central authority. Blockchain technologies improve security in the SSI systems by allowing control of the storage and disclosure of credentials and identity information. They improve the integrity, confidentiality, and interoperability of users’ information. This paper highlights the challenges that an Identity Management System (IdM) must overcome, and how blockchain-based IdMs leverage blockchain technology to meet these challenges. It also presents a comparative analysis of three SSI ecosystems based on the above-mentioned challenges. An SSI layered architecture model detailing the actors, objects, components, and processes is then proposed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Blockchain; Identity management system; Self-Sovereign identity","Authentication; Ecosystems; Interoperability; Network security; 'current; Block-chain; Centralised; Certification authorities; Comparative analyzes; Distributed systems; Identity management systems; Public keys; Self-sovereign identity; Single point; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164171140"

Since traditional identity management and authentication systems rely heavily on a trusted central authority, they cannot mitigate the effects of single points of failure. As a decentralized and distributed public ledger in a peer-to- peer (P2P) network, Blockchain (BC) technology has garnered a considerable amount of attention in the field of IDMS in recent years. Through Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), users can have full authority over their digital identity. Successful implementation of a BC-based IDMS can significantly increase the degree of privacy and security of a user's SSI. However, the integration of BC-based IMDS to provide a user with SSI is still an unorganized area of research in its early stages of development. This article presents an extensive literature review of state-of-the-art academic publications as well as commercial market offerings regarding the applicability of BC-based SSI solutions. It also provides a detailed preliminary regarding the building blocks of blockchain technology and a progressive roadmap of IDMS solutions. In order to develop an effective BC-based IDMS solution that focuses on securing a user's SSI, this article outline five essential components of a BC-based IDMS: authentication, integrity, privacy, trust, and simplicity. Furthermore, we perform a security analysis that outlines several types of adversarial threats that can cause potential damage to the BC-based IDMS. We identify and discuss associated issues and challenges by analyzing several notable BC-based IDMS solutions in academic literature. We also highlight potential research gaps and provide future research scope.  © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; identity management system; peer-to-peer network; security; self-sovereign identity","Authentication; Distributed computer systems; Distributed ledger; Ecosystems; Electronic document identification systems; Network security; Peer to peer networks; Wireless sensor networks; Block-chain; Identity management systems; Medical services; Peer-to-peer computing; Peer-to-peer networks; Security; Self-sovereign identity; Blockchain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141446920"

On one hand, collecting relevant data can help clinicians, specialists and healthcare service providers to facilitate care for patients. On the other hand, Self-Sovereign identity and the right to control personal data comes into question, because patients do not handle their data explicitly. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a novel method which would allow to securely record time-stamped data and enable patient-driven health and identity records. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in Blockchain (BC)-based self-sovereignty and patient data records in healthcare. Our motivation is to investigate the potential of BC technology for use in the patient data and identity management. As a distributed decentralized technology, BC can be very beneficial, giving patients control over their own data and self-sovereign identity. To the extent of our knowledge, there is no literature covering the same concerns. More specifically, the focus is on solutions that aim the realization of holistic BC-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Patient Health Records (PHR). EHR and PHR are used to record patient data, such as the doctor's notes upon a visit and radiology images. Hence, they include critical information regarding patient's privacy and identity. Therefore, development of pure decentralized Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) is a great challenge in terms of architectural and technical structure of the systems. Designing robust and reliable EHR and PHR, which represent the foundation of many other healthcare services, relies on carefully finding the balance in a trade-off between many factors, such as level of decentralization, privacy, scalability and data throughput. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art and provide an analysis on the design trade-offs. © 2013 IEEE.","Blockchain; Healthcare; Privacy; Self-sovereignty","Blockchain; Economic and social effects; Electronic document identification systems; Health care; Hospital data processing; Design tradeoff; Digital identity; Electronic health record; Healthcare information systems (HIS); Healthcare services; Identity management; State of the art; Technical structures; Medical computing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085549368"

Where there are issues of incomplete or inconsistent or repudiated information, or data privacy, it comes into play by not making it possible to add, delete or modify data that has already been validated within a blockchain. The paper presents a possible application of blockchain technologies to the automotive sector. The authors analyze the main critical issues that a driver and his respective insurance company face following an accident, a situation in which an abundant amount of data is exchanged by all parties involved. The objective of the paper is to find a way to manage the situation after a car accident in the fastest and most effective way possible, recording all sensitive data and ensuring an efficient transfer to the insurance companies, without the possibility of fraud, using the blockchain. The main result obtained was to design a software application that, running on smartphones, would allow the driver to fill in the CID (Amicable statement of accident, also known as knock-for-knock agreement). In order to solve the typical criticalities mentioned before, the application will exploit Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) credentials and the car's digital passport, both blockchain-based technologies that will be exposed in this paper.  © 2021 AEIT.","Car's digital passport; Digital CID; SSI","Accidents; Application programs; Automotive industry; Data privacy; Insurance; Automotive sector; Block-chain; Car accidents; Car digital passport; Critical issues; Digital CID; Digital passports; Insurance companies; Self-sovereign identity; Sensitive datas; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124579227"

The designed protocol ensures minimal disclosure of information to a single trusted third party. In addition, it allows zero disclosure of information to service providers requiring proof of authentication or identification.

This field has been evolving for many decades with a number of Identity Management (IDM) models being proposed and employed; however, few were able to solve the issue of sovereignty of an identity and storage-control of its associated personal and confidential data. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) was introduced to solve this crucial issue offering a user full sovereignty of their identity and storage-control of their associated personal and confidential data. Alongside ownership of an identity, it maintains all private information in a Digital Wallet which is owned and controlled by the user. However, SSI is an emerging IDM, therefore it requires careful evaluation of various aspects of SSI for it to become an operative IDM. This paper proposes several specifications to evaluate any SSI solution. Subsequently, it analyses two emerging SSI solutions uPort and Sovrin. Finally, an evaluation of uPort and Sovrin SSI is performed utilising the proposed specifications, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  © 2020 IEEE.","Digital Wallet; Identity Management; IDM; Self-Sovereign Identity; Sovrin; Specifications; SSI; uPort","Blockchain; Digital storage; Electronic document identification systems; Electronic money; Information management; Specifications; Confidential data; Cyberspaces; Digital identity; Digital wallets; Identity management; Private information; Storage control; Mobile cloud computing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096500989"

With the booming of edge computing technology, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based delivery system is expected to achieve higher efficiency and low latency. However, the UAV often collects user-specific data during the delivery process, the data-leakage or security/privacy breaching could occur during the data-sharing process between the edge nodes and UAV devices. Privacy-preserving issues are further refraining from the popularity of the UAV-based logistic systems. It is believed that the UAV tracking and identity verification system can provide imminent access-level security and privacy protection, which is urgently required to eliminate the practical concerns under the edge computing-based environment. To the best knowledge of authors, for the first time, this paper proposes a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) integrated framework with the latest Blockchain technology for UAV-based delivery system. It is expected to protect the edge computing-based UAV delivery system against security flaws and privacy concerns. In this work, the benefits of using SSI with Blockchain technology are analyzed, the efficiency of identifying and authenticating UAVs and their respective users is further experimented and discussed. The experimental results show that the integrated SSI framework with Blockchain can effectively improve the efficiency of the user identity management system as well as the identity verification process in the delivery process. © 2021 IEEE.","Blockchain; Edge Computing; Self-Sovereign Identity; UAV Delivery System","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Authentication; Blockchain; Cluster computing; Data Sharing; Edge computing; Efficiency; Privacy by design; Computing technology; Higher efficiency; Identity verification; Integrated frameworks; Privacy concerns; Privacy preserving; Security and privacy protection; Security/privacy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114852031"

Unlocking the full and real potential of local energy markets is among the opportunities to be demystified in the coming years, with blockchain technology being a prominent enabler. Important subcomponents such as functional and fair local energy pricing mechanisms and management algorithms will be required for next-generation digital local energy trading and management platforms. Even though rapid digitalization of the energy sector offers considerable advantages, it also increases the cyber-physical risk levels of energy systems in general. The proposed framework of this paper accommodates considerable undiscovered aspects of democratization of the energy systems and future digital shared economy conventions.

To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public. © 2018 IEEE.","Blockchain; Digital Identity; Distributed Ledger; Zero-Knowledge Proof","Blockchain; Electronic document identification systems; Internet of things; Acceptable performance; Digital identity; Distributed Ledger; General publics; Model properties; Trusted communications; Trusted third parties; Zero knowledge proof; Green computing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067835043"

In this paper, a framework, named EverSSDI, using smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain is constructed, which provides a unique identifier to normalise differentiated user identities. A finegrained authorisation mechanism is designed based on the Hierarchical Deterministic protocol (HD protocol) to solve the fragmentation problem of identity information. Besides, a reliable information verification mechanism is elaborated to enhance the credibility of the digital information. In addition, two novel methods are proposed for identity recovery, one of which is based on Social Networking Services (SNS) authorisation and the other Ethereum Oracles. The final implementation and discussion show that the user has self-sovereign management authority, which enables the user to become the real dominant of his/her identity rather than only a prover of digital identity. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Blockchain; Decentralisation; Digital identity; Ethereum; Hierarchical deterministic protocol; IPFS; Self-sovereign; Smart contract","Electronic document identification systems; Ethereum; Decentralisation; Deterministic protocols; Digital identity; IPFS; Self-sovereign; Blockchain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068063921"
