This creates a large context that implies a financial and identity data exchange paradigm, which faces challenges to balance customer experience, security, and the self-control over personal identity information. We propose Self-Sovereign Banking Identity (SSBI), a Blockchain-based self-sovereign identity (SSI) to secure private data sharing by utilizing trusted customer’s banking cards as a key storage and identity transaction-signing enclave. The design and implementation of the SSI framework is based on the Veramo SDK and Ethereum to overcome the limitation of signing curve availability on the current banking Java Cards needed for Hyperledger Indy. SSBI uses the elliptic curve SECP256K1 for transaction signing, which exists for several payment cards in the market. SSBI enables automated financial services and trust in the service provider communication. This work analyzes the flow and framework components, and evaluates the usability, integration, and performance in terms of throughput, latency, security, and complexity. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared with related solutions. The presented prototype implementation is based on a test Ethereum network and signing transactions on the banking card. The preliminary results show that SSBI provides an effective solution for integrating the customer’s banking cards to secure open banking identity exchange. Furthermore, it allows the integration of several scenarios to support trusted open banking.

In respect to confidential computing, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is incorporated with the system to protect the privacy of the individual's data and prevent unauthorized secondary use when being shared with potential users. In the area of advanced data usage control, the solution leverages the PRIV-DRM solution architecture to derive a novel approach to licensing of data usage to prevent unauthorized secondary usage of data held by individuals. Specifically, our design covers necessary roles in the data-sharing ecosystem: The issuer of personal data, the individual holder of the personal data (i.e., the data subject), a trusted data storage manager, a trusted license distributor, and the data consumer.

We make the DID documents on the blockchain editable successfully and realize the update and revocation of DIDs. Then, we observe that DIURS can meet the structural stability and irreversibility requirements. The time of identity search and update is milliseconds.

AttriChain realizes on-chain access control and distributed identity governance by allowing users to create transactions anonymously using their transaction keys and their attributes. It provides unlinkability and anonymity of transactions belonging to legitimate users whereas provides accountability for those whom other members in the network regard as questionable or malicious. The design of threshold traceability of anonymous transactions allows network members to trace transactions back to the sender without violating the decentralized property of blockchain. In AttriChain, the spontaneous tracing of misbehaviors in the network distributes the power of identity governance to multiple independent tracing members instead of depending on single-point management. It significantly increases user privacy and autonomy in a permissioned network and facilitates auditing at the same time. We define the functionality and the protocol of AttriChain in the universal composable model.

As a result, linking or aggregating a complete record for a patient is a major technological, legal, and operational challenge. One of the factors that has made clinical data integration so difficult to achieve is the lack of a universal ID for everyone. This leads to other related problems of having to prove identity at each interaction with the health system and repeatedly providing basic information on demographics, insurance, payment, and medical conditions. Traditional solutions that require complex governance, expensive technology, and risks to privacy and security of the data have failed adequately to solve this interoperability problem. We describe the technical design decisions of a patient-centric decentralized health identity management system using the blockchain technology, called MediLinker, to address some of these challenges. Design: Our multidisciplinary research group developed and implemented an identity wallet, which uses the blockchain technology to manage verifiable credentials issued by healthcare clinics, banks, and insurance com-panies. To manage patient’s self-sovereign identity, we leveraged the Hyperledger Indy blockchain framework to store patient’s decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the schemas or format for each credential type. In con-trast, the credentials containing patient data are stored ‘off-ledger’ in each person’s wallet and accessible via a computer or smartphone. We used Hyperledger Aries as a middleware layer (API: Application Programming Interface) to connect Hyperledger Indy with the front-end, which was developed using a JavaScript frame-work, ReactJS (Web Application) and React Native (iOS Application). Results: MediLinker allows users to store their personal data on digital wallets, which they control. It uses a decentralized trusted identity using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. Patients use MediLinker to register and share their information securely and in a trusted system with healthcare and other service provid-ers. Each MediLinker wallet can have six credential types: health ID with patient demographics, insurance, medication list including COVID-19 vaccination status, credit card, medical power of attorney (MPOA) for guardians of pediatric or geriatric patients, and research consent. The system allows for in-person and remote granting and revoking of such permissions for care, research, or other purposes without repeatedly requiring physical identity documents or enrollment information. Conclusion: We successfully developed and tested a blockchain-based technical architecture, described in this article, as an identity management system that may be operationalized and scaled for future implementation to improve patient experience and control over their personal information. © 2022, Partners in Digital Health.

Furthermore, given the inherent risks associated with these occupations, it is imperative to have a secure healthcare system to meet their specific needs.

The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a new class of user-controlled resilient identity management systems that are enabled by distributed ledger technology. This paper examines how SSI management can be used in a public transportation sector that spans different operators in multiple countries. Specifically, the paper explores how a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system can draw on the SSI framework to provide high-level security and transparency for all involved parties in public transportation ecosystems. Accordingly, building on analyses of the existing public transportation ticketing solutions, we elicited requirements of a comparable system based on the SSI principles. Next, we developed a low-fidelity prototype to showcase how passengers can utilize standardized travel credentials that are valid across different transportation networks in Europe. The proposed system eliminates the need for multiple travel cards (i.e., one for each transportation provider) and empowers individuals to have better control over the use of their identities while they utilize interoperable ticketing systems across Europe. Overall, building on the public transportation case, we offer a proof-of-concept that shows how individuals can better manage their identity credentials via the SSI framework. © 2021 The Authors",,,"Stockburger, Lukas (57846663700); Kokosioulis, Georgios (57846888300); Mukkamala, Alivelu (57189869807); Mukkamala, Raghava Rao (26768153800); Avital, Michel (6506180116)",57846663700; 57846888300; 57189869807; 26768153800; 6506180116,Blockchain: Research and Applications,100014,,,,27.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117398661&doi=10.1016%2fj.bcra.2021.100014&partnerID=40&md5=ff42e00fcfdaa2c89a18a2b09e4ad35b,Blockchain; Distributed ledger; Identity management; Intelligent transport systems; Payment systems infrastructure; Self-sovereign identity,Authentication; Distributed ledger; Intelligent systems; Interoperability; Traffic control; Block-chain; Identity management; Intelligent transport; Intelligent transport system; Payment system infrastructure; Payment systems; Public transportation; Self-sovereign identity; System infrastructure; Transport systems; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85117398661,,,,,,,,,,,

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a technology to solve cross-domain authentication. However, there are problems such as difficulty in mutual trust between multiple certificate authority nodes (CA), failure of single point, and low efficiency in the traditional PKI method. Blockchain is a promising technology for decentralized trust management by providing consistent data storage, which gives impetus to the further development of cross-domain identity authentication. Thus, this article apply blockchain to cross-domain identity authentication. To solve the defects of the traditional PKI method, the design requirements are analyzed firstly, based on the analysis result, we proposed a double-layer cross-domain identity authentication model by constructing a consortium blockchain which is comprised of authentication server nodes (AS) and some internal blockchain, the model can highly improve the scalability of the PKI system without changing the internal architecture. Then a novel authentication protocol was put forward. The protocol can improve the efficiency of online cross-domain identity authentication transactions by verifying the hash instead of the signature of their certificate. By putting the generation process of the blockchain certificate and the storage process of its hash in the registration operation and reducing the authentication process for AS and CA, the efficiency is further improved. Finally, the protocol was evaluated by security and performance analysis. The results display our protocol can guarantee security and has an excellent performance in cross-domain identity authentication transactions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,"Zhao, Gang (56658903700); Di, Bingbing (57197723071); He, Hui (57215806420)",56658903700; 57197723071; 57215806420,Transactions on Emerging Telecommunications Technologies,e4377,,,,4.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117383825&doi=10.1002%2fett.4377&partnerID=40&md5=100aa7f8a10b72a78ea4d9d6fb16f350,,Authentication; Digital storage; Efficiency; Information management; Network architecture; Public key cryptography; Authentication servers; Block-chain; Certificate authority; Cross-domain; Decentralised; Identity authentication; Identity authentication protocol; Protocol cans; Public key infrastructure; Server nodes; Blockchain,Article,Final,,2-s2.0-85117383825,,,,,,,,,,,

Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) has been proposed as the next generation paradigm for decentralised identity management. Research on SSI is getting more and more traction, focusing mainly on the management of users’ identifiers and on providing a standard way to express and verify credentials. Instead, this paper focuses on the understanding of the role of trust in SSI and it provides new insight into the trust relationships existing between the different SSI actors. Indeed, the analysis of such roles and the relationships existing between SSI actors reveals that the current paradigm suffers from trust issues between the verifier and the issuer of a verifiable credential. In order to cope this problem, the paper proposes a new multi-layer framework that exploits trust relationships defined by the actors of the SSI standards (verifiers and issuers of verifiable credentials). An implementation of the framework through Solidity smart contracts has been proposed and deployed on both private and public blockchain networks in order to assess its capabilities. In addition, a dataset related to the spread of spam reviews has been exploited to test the benefits and performance of the proposed framework, demonstrating that it is able to improve the reliability of the SSI paradigm in real-world scenario. © 2023 The Author(s)",,,"De Salve, Andrea (57193351024); Di Francesco Maesa, Damiano (57193156981); Mori, Paolo (15127782100); Ricci, Laura (7007055633); Puccia, Alessandro (58537518400)",57193351024; 57193156981; 15127782100; 7007055633; 58537518400,Online Social Networks and Media,100265,,,,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167990287&doi=10.1016%2fj.osnem.2023.100265&partnerID=40&md5=99b3b502324c8aaa0d571ddbbc634dd7,Distributed Ledger Technology; Self Sovereign Identity; Trust Management System; Web of Trust,Distributed ledger; Smart contract; Statistical tests; Block-chain; Decentralisation; Decentralized system; Distributed ledg technology; Multi-layers; Self sovereign identity; Trust frameworks; Trust management systems; Trust relationship; Web of trust; Blockchain,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85167990287,,,,,,,,,,,

It is often suggested that blockchain enables the decentralised and trusted ecosystem required for an SSI system. We evaluate whether blockchain can provide the necessary decentralisation and trust. We argue that blockchain has the potential to enable this ecosystem, but this is dependent on the type of blockchain used to implement an SSI system.

A secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient identity solution is essential but challenging. This paper examines the current literature and provides a systematic literature review in three stages based on the three research questions (RQ) that show the assessment and interpretation process step by step. Based on the parameters and RQ specified in the research methodology section, a total of 43 primary articles have been selected from the 251 articles extracted from various scientific databases. The majority of these articles are concerned with evaluating the existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions and their role in the blockchain-based land registry system to address the compliance issues in the existing SSI solutions with SSI principles and find the best possible SSI solution to address the identity problems in the land registry. The existing digital identity solutions cannot handle the requirements of the identity principle and are prone to various limitations like centralization and dependency on third parties that further augment the chance of security threats. SSI has been designed to overcome these limitations and provide a secure, reliable, and efficient identity solution that gives complete control to the users over their personal identity information (PII).

This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efficiency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system.

Authentication systems mostly assume the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) in the form of a Certificate Authority (CA) or as an authentication server. However, relying on a TTP implies that users do not directly manage their identities, but delegate this role to a third party. This intrinsic issue can generate trust concerns (e.g., identity theft), as well as privacy concerns towards the third party. The main objective of this research is to present an autonomous and independent solution where users can store their self created credentials without depending on TTPs. To this aim, the use of an TTP autonomous and independent network is needed, where users can manage and assess their identities themselves. In this paper, we propose the framework called Three Blockchains Identity Management with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (3BI-ECC).

The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth application’s domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner. We implemented smart contracts on an Ethereum consortium blockchain to facilities identification and authentication procedures. We further analyze the performance using different metrics, including transaction gas cost, transaction per second, number of blocks lost, and block propagation time.

With this rapid expansion, it faces some major hurdles in data secrecy, privacy, and device integrity, and perhaps, in general, digital identity has been a major problem on the internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has provided a standardized format through which one can specify his identity called Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs). Blockchain technology, alongside decentralized identifiers and public-key cryptography, offers a peer-to-peer identity and credential management model through self-sovereign identity. Combining the decentralized identity and blockchains provides us with verifiable credentials through which one can verify the identities of transacting peers by decentralized registration and discovery of public keys needed to verify digital signatures. This combined framework is trusted, permissioned, supports device registration and verification along with revocation of device credentials, is secure, respects the privacy of the participating nodes, and maintains the integrity of their data. With several new communication protocols being developed for IoT and leveraging the Blockchain protocols in the domain of IoT, this paper quantitatively compares the performance of the well-known IoT communication protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, and DIDComm in real-time testbed on various parameters, and the results are tabulated.

The efficacy of the system in identifying and extracting fields from identification cards is attributed to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Subsequently, the system dissects the fields into smaller constituents to facilitate optical character recognition (OCR) and user authentication. The utilisation of the zero-knowledge proof concept by DIDSB enables secure authentication with service providers.

Most patient tokenization is the centralized approach that is unable to address data security concerns fundamentally. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), which are non-transferable cryptographic assets on the blockchain, have the potential to provide secure, decentralized, and trustworthy patient tokenization. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to verify the ownership of NFTs in a decentralized manner. Methods: We have developed a blockchain architecture that contains four modules: (1) Creation module for NFTs creation, (2) Linkage module to link the local patients' accounts to their NFTs, (3) Authentication module that allows patients to permit healthcare providers to access their token, and (4) Exchange module, which involves the HIE process and the validation of the legitimacy of the token through SSI. Results: A case study has been conducted on the proposed architecture. Over 3 million transactions have been completed successfully with a blockchain validation and written time of 1.17 s on average. A stability test has also been conducted with a higher throughput of 200 transactions per second running for an hour with an average transaction processing time of 1.42 s. Conclusions: This study proposed a blockchain architecture that achieves SSI-enabled NFT-based patient tokenization. Our architecture design, implementation, and case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and potential of NFT with SSI to establish a secure, transparent, and patient-centric identity management and HIE. © 2023 The Authors",,,"Zhuang, Yan (57194151423); Shyu, Chi-Ren (7005681170); Hong, Shenda (56245620000); Li, Pengfei (57220436061); Zhang, Luxia (57449776800)",57194151423; 7005681170; 56245620000; 57220436061; 57449776800,Computers in Biology and Medicine,106778,,,,2.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150463220&doi=10.1016%2fj.compbiomed.2023.106778&partnerID=40&md5=3c17e58eaa275d9a8c3df821d76558fb,Blockchain; Health information exchange; Non-fungible token; Patient tokenization; Self-sovereign identity; Smart contract,Blockchain; Computer Security; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Architecture; Blockchain; Health care; Health risks; Information dissemination; Block-chain; Case-studies; Decentralised; Health information exchange; Health informations; Information exchanges; Non-fungible token; Patient tokenization; Self-sovereign identity; Tokenization; adult; article; blockchain; feasibility study; health care personnel; human; medical information system; running; validation process; computer security; Smart contract,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,2-s2.0-85150463220,,,,,,,,,,,

Solutions for health data management, as in storing it, sharing and processing it, are emerging quickly and were significantly boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic that created a need to move things online. EHRs make a crucial part of digital identity data, and the same digital identity trends - as in self-sovereign identity powered by decentralized ledger technologies like blockchain, are being researched or implemented in contexts managing digital interactions between health facilities, patients, and health professionals. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution enabling secure exchange of EHRs between different parties powered by a self-sovereign identity (SSI) wallet and decentralized identifiers. We also make use of a consortium IPFS network for off-chain storage and attribute-based encryption (ABE) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. Through our solution, we grant users full control over their medical data and enable them to securely share it in total confidentiality over secure communication channels between user wallets using encryption. We also use DIDs for better user privacy and limit any possible correlations or identification by using pairwise DIDs.

The security is not enough, and it is very vulnerable to replay attacks and dictionary attacks. Dynamic passwords Although authentication is more secure, if there is a problem with the time synchronization between the server and the client, the user will not be able to login for a long time. Moreover, the password of the dynamic password is the same within a period of time, and it is also vulnerable to replay attacks.

This research explains how technological, organisational and environmental (TOE) factors affect organisations’ adoption behaviour toward BDIDM. This study aims to determine the most critical factors affecting the behaviour while assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the model involved, i.e., TOE-BDIDM. Online questionnaires are used to survey 111 information and cybersecurity practitioners within South African organisations. The analysis combines binary logistic regression modelling, Structural Equation Modelling of the measurement model, and chi-squared tests. The results suggest TOE factors positively or negatively affect adoption behaviour. The behaviour is significantly affected by technology characteristics, i.e., BDIDM’s disruptive nature, and is associated with Blockchain type. Indeed, the majority of participants intended to recommend BDIDM to their organisations yet paradoxically preferred private-permissioned blockchain the most, revealing resistance to decentralised and privacy-preserving BDIDM models like Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The latter might be utopian or unsustainable for organisations.

However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,"Kara, Mustafa (57325378600); Merzeh, Hisham R.J.

On the basis of the findings, the paper proposes the following enhancements: 1) A novel attribute sensitivity score model for self-sovereign identity agents to ascertain the sensitivity of attributes shared in credential exchanges 2) A method of mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks between peer self-sovereign identities and 3) A novel quantitative model for determining a credential issuer's reputation based on the number of issued credentials in a window period, which is then utilized to calculate an overall confidence level score for the issuer. © 2020 IEEE.",,,"Bhattacharya, Manas Pratim (57221599831); Zavarsky, Pavol (6602713259); Butakov, Sergey (25931992100)",57221599831; 6602713259; 25931992100,"2020 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications, ISNCC 2020",9297357,,,,15.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099584479&doi=10.1109%2fISNCC49221.2020.9297357&partnerID=40&md5=0392557d8ab992fa87748e75f24f67e6,Attribute sensitivity; Blockchain; Confidence level; Credential exchange; Data disclosure; Hyperledger Indy; Man-in-the-middle attack; Reputation; Self-sovereign identity,Computer networks; Network security; Privacy by design; Risk perception; Confidence levels; Man in the middle attacks; Personally identifiable information; Privacy and security; Quantitative modeling; Security and privacy; User autonomy; Window period; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85099584479,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to conventional blockchains, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, many SSI systems do not capture on ledger the exchange of transactional data between individuals. By not capturing the exchange of transaction data such SSI systems have the advantage of complying with privacy regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations, but, at the same time, have the disadvantage of not capturing evidence that an exchange has happened. Such evidence, however, may be needed for audit and accountability purposes. To achieve these objectives and to preserve privacy, we leverage archival principles to introduce a novel concept of a proof registry, which we define as a set of technical components, data structures, and process flows, that assures that authoritative records offering evidence of transactions is captured, stored, and accessible.

Data manipulation and tampering of emissions values due to the economic incentives and environmental and health issues require a tamper-proof solution with the use of blockchain (BC) where the integrity of data is ensured. In this paper, we propose the integration of a public permissioned Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) framework with a permissioned consortium BC based architecture. This innovatively supports the decentralization of the authentication and authorization processes to overcome the single point of failure problems and the use of SSI to assign identities to IoT devices. Additionally, it gives full control to the holders for their identities, whether they are humans, organizations or smart vehicles. With the practice of advanced zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptographic techniques, the exposure of sensitive and private information is minimized to the absolute necessary and gains in performance and scalability are achieved. Furthermore, the way this ecosystem of technologies is combined guarantees a trusted environment for enabling and automating vehicles' emissions certification according to emissions standards and regulations.

This requires counterparty networks to know the identities and certification chains of each other's members, establishing a common trust basis rooted in identity. But permissioned networks are ad hoc consortia of existing organizations, whose network affiliations may not be well-known or well-established even though their individual identities are. In this paper, we describe an architecture and set of protocols for distributed identity management across permissioned blockchain networks to establish a trust basis for data sharing. Networks wishing to interoperate can associate with one or more distributed identity registries that maintain credentials on shared ledgers managed by groups of reputed identity providers. A network's participants possess self-sovereign decentralized identities (DIDs) on these registries and can obtain privacy-preserving verifiable membership credentials. During interoperation, networks can securely and dynamically discover each others' latest membership lists and members' credentials.

In essence, multi-party agreement signing (MPAS) can be reckoned as a special case of the multi-party fair exchange (MPFE) for signatures over a digital agreement. However, such general MPAS protocols have not seen wide adoptions in practice, possibly due to the lack of incentives to maintain the signing platform. Practically, monetary-incentivized enterprises exist to act as a trusted third party (TTP) and provide signing services. However, such an agreement signing flow still suffers from certain limitations in terms of insecure and inefficient operations. To this end, we propose a secure and efficient framework for multi-party agreement signing based on decentralized identity, blockchain and decentralized storage network (DSN). The framework consists of two subsystems where the identity subsystem contains an extensible three-tier user identity model atop decentralized identity, and the agreement signing subsystem, empowered by the identity subsystem, DSN and several novel designs, achieves security and efficiency design goals. For the convenience of explanation, we suppose that a centralized signing service provider (SSP) is properly involved, i.e., sensitive information is still protected against the SSP, and acts as a TTP to ensure the crucial properties such as fairness and coordinate the signing activities. Our design is also compatible with other methods, e.g., ensuring fairness via blockchain, which removes the single point of failure of SSP. We prototype the framework and the performance evaluation shows effectiveness and efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,,"He, Songlin (57205445718); Sun, Tong (57219699023); Tang, Qiang (57192808992); Wu, Chase (8594551300); Lipka, Nedim (25927367600); Wigington, Curtis (57200298411); Jain, Rajiv (55449841600)",57205445718; 57219699023; 57192808992; 8594551300; 25927367600; 57200298411; 55449841600,Communications in Computer and Information Science,,3.0,17.0,14.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145258099&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-8043-5_1&partnerID=40&md5=0e27576ce8bbda3195db0fb9a12dea2a,Agreement signing; Blockchain; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage networks; Self-sovereign identity,Efficiency; Network security; Agreement signing; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized identity; Decentralized storage network; Self-sovereign identity; Service provider; Storage networks; Trusted third parties; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85145258099,,,,,,,,,,,

However, as the continuous development of smart tourism industry, various types of dishonest even illegal behavior have gradually emerged. Due to the absence of an effective identity authentication mechanism for the travel services provider, there are illegal travel agencies, unqualified part-time tour guides, etc., thereby harming the rights and interests of tourist. Considering the above problems, this paper proposes a smart tourism identity authentication service based on blockchain and Decentralized Identifier (DID). The service requester can verify the attributes of the DID, and then check the certificate. By exploiting the collaborative management of on-chain and off-chain data, the entire process of smart tourism service identity authentication is safe, reliable and traceable. In order to alleviate the storage pressure of blockchain, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is introduced to store DID document and Verifiable Credential certificate.

In the proposed platform, the DID and a credential represent an user's digital identity. We define DID chaincode and credential protocol to cover the full lifecycle of a user's digital identity. We build a complete consortium blockchain and application environment, and implement a prototype as an App for Android-based phones.

To this aim, this paper proposes Algorand Identity (AlgoID), a new SSI framework for the Algorand blockchain which differs from the already existing one, because it is fully blockchain based, i.e., it exploits Algorand itself for the storage of the data identity and as the registry location.

In this paper, a blockchain (BCN)-based SSI system has been developed as a new identity plane to enable routing device owners in Autonomous Systems (ASs) to have greater control over inter-domain networks (IDNs), potentially across multiple paths that comply with routing device-defined preferences. The proposed system provides identity management, authentication and transparent information about routers, attested by ASs, while maintaining the privacy of sensitive network details. Device-level information and preferences are protected by BCN-based SSI. We used a GNS3 network emulation test bed and Hyperledger Indy distributed identity management system to test the proposed solution's AS convergence time and credential operation time respectively. Experiment results demonstrated that when the proposed routing system was used in combination with the BCNbased SSI credential management platform, the convergence time for the Inter-AS and Intra-AS systems became longer as the number of routers increased, whereas the credential operations had shorter processing times.

The need for decentralization of identity is because it gives back control of identity credentials to identity holders and allows them to control when, how, and with whom to share their credentials. Self-sovereign Identity is an arising concept, which provides a way for digital identification. It enables the entities to control their identity and data flow in the digital world while enhancing privacy and security.

Our proposal of the AESP-based SSI architecture and system protocols, ∏Gatt, demonstrates the powerfulness of hardware-assisted security and the formal abstraction of AESPs, fitting into building a proper SSI system that satisfies Sybil-resistance. Assuming AESPs and Gatt, the protocols may eliminate the online distributed committee assumed in other research such as CanDID; thus, ∏Gatt allows not to rely on multiparty computation (MPC), and it brings drastic flexibility and efficiency compared with the existing SSI systems.  © 2022 IEEE.",,,"Moriyama, Koichi (7103036733); Otsuka, Akira (55580962900)",7103036733; 55580962900,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain, Blockchain 2022",,1.0,10.0,9.0,0.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139912641&doi=10.1109%2fBlockchain55522.2022.00012&partnerID=40&md5=3a548a8747face5eb181b39e107443fa,Attested Execution Secure Processors; Decentralized Digital Identity; Permissionless Blockchain; Self-Sovereign Identity; Sybil-Resistance,Abstracting; Electronic document identification systems; Network architecture; Online systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; 'current; Attested execution secure processor; Block-chain; Decentralised; Decentralized digital identity; Digital identity; Permissionless blockchain; Secure processors; Self-sovereign identity; Sybil-resistance; Blockchain,Conference paper,Final,,2-s2.0-85139912641,,,,,,,,,,,

A new approach to data encryption and hashing can resolve concerns of privacy, security, data handling, and more. Blockchain Technology and the Internet Of Things will improve the current ecosystem. The devised model will be using the AES algorithm for the encryption of biometrics and demographic data. Additionally, the symmetrically distributed storage system, the InterPlanetary File System(IPFS) will be used and data will be hashed by SHA-256.

Storing identity data on these types of centralized storage platforms(e.g cloud storage, central servers) becomes a major privacy concern since various types of attacks and data breaches can happen. With this research, we are proposing blockchain and self-sovereign identity based digital identity (KYC-Know Your Customer) platform 'Casper' to address the issues on centralized identity systems. 'Casper ' is an Android/iOS based mobile identity wallet application that combines the integration of blockchain and a self-sovereign identity-based approach. Unlike centralized identity systems, the actual identities of the customer/users are stored in the customers' mobile wallet application. The proof of these identities is stored in the blockchain-based decentralized storage as a self-sovereign identity proof. Casper platforms' Self-Sovereign Identity(SSI)-based system provides a Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP) mechanism to verify the identity information. Casper platform can be adopted in various domains such as healthcare, banking, government organization etc. As a use case, we have discussed building a digital identity wallet for banking customers with the Casper platform. Casper provides a secure, decentralized and ZKP verifiable identity by using blockchain and SSI based approach.

The rise of self-sovereign identities (SSIs) based on blockchain technologies provides individuals with ownership and control over their personal data and allows them to share their data with others using a sort of “digital safe.” Fundamentally, people have the sole ownership of their identity data and control when and how it is shared, protecting their privacy. As these data need to be validated to be trusted, they may become a more important data source for digital information sharing and transactions than the formal source of identity controlled by governments. Furthermore, SSIs can be used for interacting digitally with any organization. These developments change the relationship between government, companies, and individuals. We explore information sharing and governance in the digital society using blockchain-based SSIs. In addition, the impact of SSIs on data storage in the digital world is assessed.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an emerging IDM system which incorporates several required features to ensure that identity is sovereign, secure, reliable and generic. It is an evolving IDM system, thus it is essential to analyse its various features to determine its effectiveness in coping with the dynamic requirements of identity and its current challenges.

Since traditional identity management and authentication systems rely heavily on a trusted central authority, they cannot mitigate the effects of single points of failure. As a decentralized and distributed public ledger in a peer-to- peer (P2P) network, Blockchain (BC) technology has garnered a considerable amount of attention in the field of IDMS in recent years. Through Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), users can have full authority over their digital identity. Successful implementation of a BC-based IDMS can significantly increase the degree of privacy and security of a user's SSI. However, the integration of BC-based IMDS to provide a user with SSI is still an unorganized area of research in its early stages of development. This article presents an extensive literature review of state-of-the-art academic publications as well as commercial market offerings regarding the applicability of BC-based SSI solutions. It also provides a detailed preliminary regarding the building blocks of blockchain technology and a progressive roadmap of IDMS solutions. In order to develop an effective BC-based IDMS solution that focuses on securing a user's SSI, this article outline five essential components of a BC-based IDMS: authentication, integrity, privacy, trust, and simplicity. Furthermore, we perform a security analysis that outlines several types of adversarial threats that can cause potential damage to the BC-based IDMS. We identify and discuss associated issues and challenges by analyzing several notable BC-based IDMS solutions in academic literature.

On one hand, collecting relevant data can help clinicians, specialists and healthcare service providers to facilitate care for patients. On the other hand, Self-Sovereign identity and the right to control personal data comes into question, because patients do not handle their data explicitly. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a novel method which would allow to securely record time-stamped data and enable patient-driven health and identity records. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in Blockchain (BC)-based self-sovereignty and patient data records in healthcare. Our motivation is to investigate the potential of BC technology for use in the patient data and identity management. As a distributed decentralized technology, BC can be very beneficial, giving patients control over their own data and self-sovereign identity. To the extent of our knowledge, there is no literature covering the same concerns. More specifically, the focus is on solutions that aim the realization of holistic BC-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Patient Health Records (PHR). EHR and PHR are used to record patient data, such as the doctor's notes upon a visit and radiology images. Hence, they include critical information regarding patient's privacy and identity. Therefore, development of pure decentralized Healthcare Information Systems (HIS) is a great challenge in terms of architectural and technical structure of the systems. Designing robust and reliable EHR and PHR, which represent the foundation of many other healthcare services, relies on carefully finding the balance in a trade-off between many factors, such as level of decentralization, privacy, scalability and data throughput.

Blockchain as technology was initially introduced as a cryptocurrency and there have been challenges in its adoption for enterprise applications such as identity management. DID is emerging as one of the strong blockchain adoption use cases. Industry pioneers and users across domains have started exploring DID use cases, which help better protect their personal data and application access control as compared to traditional, central, or federated identity management models. In this exploratory work, the authors employ qualitative secondary case-based study research methodology to understand the challenges of the current digital identity management landscape and explore the possible benefits of DID as an emerging identity management paradigm.

Having service providers continue to offer their centric solutions is inefficient in terms of duplication, has serious security lacunae and is cumbersome to the users. The self-sovereign Identity concept, which includes the individual's consolidated digital identity and verified attributes, enables the users of data to exert their ownership and gain insights from their data's usage. The authentication and verification of digital identity is essential to achieve the privacy and security of distributed digital identities. In this paper, we provide a coherent view of the central concepts of self-sovereign Identity, including the components of identity proofing and authentication solutions for different self-sovereign Identity solutions. We discussed an overview of Identity management approaches, introducing an architecture overview as well as the relevant actors in such a system and blockchain technology as solution for distributed user-centric identity.

This field has been evolving for many decades with a number of Identity Management (IDM) models being proposed and employed; however, few were able to solve the issue of sovereignty of an identity and storage-control of its associated personal and confidential data. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) was introduced to solve this crucial issue offering a user full sovereignty of their identity and storage-control of their associated personal and confidential data. Alongside ownership of an identity, it maintains all private information in a Digital Wallet which is owned and controlled by the user. However, SSI is an emerging IDM, therefore it requires careful evaluation of various aspects of SSI for it to become an operative IDM. This paper proposes several specifications to evaluate any SSI solution. Subsequently, it analyses two emerging SSI solutions uPort and Sovrin. Finally, an evaluation of uPort and Sovrin SSI is performed utilising the proposed specifications, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  © 2020 IEEE.",,,"Naik, Nitin (56956517600); Jenkins, Paul (57189685924)",56956517600; 57189685924,"Proceedings - 2020 8th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Cloud Computing, Services, and Engineering, MobileCloud 2020",9126742,90.0,95.0,5.0,45.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096500989&doi=10.1109%2fMobileCloud48802.2020.00021&partnerID=40&md5=3cc1f61d0bd144d8ee45ca58638f135c,Digital Wallet; Identity Management; IDM; Self-Sovereign Identity; Sovrin; Specifications; SSI; uPort,Blockchain; Digital storage; Electronic document identification systems; Electronic money; Information management; Specifications; Confidential data; Cyberspaces; Digital identity; Digital wallets; Identity management; Private information; Storage control; Mobile cloud computing,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,2-s2.0-85096500989,,,,,,,,,,,

With the booming of edge computing technology, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based delivery system is expected to achieve higher efficiency and low latency. However, the UAV often collects user-specific data during the delivery process, the data-leakage or security/privacy breaching could occur during the data-sharing process between the edge nodes and UAV devices. Privacy-preserving issues are further refraining from the popularity of the UAV-based logistic systems. It is believed that the UAV tracking and identity verification system can provide imminent access-level security and privacy protection, which is urgently required to eliminate the practical concerns under the edge computing-based environment. To the best knowledge of authors, for the first time, this paper proposes a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) integrated framework with the latest Blockchain technology for UAV-based delivery system. It is expected to protect the edge computing-based UAV delivery system against security flaws and privacy concerns. In this work, the benefits of using SSI with Blockchain technology are analyzed, the efficiency of identifying and authenticating UAVs and their respective users is further experimented and discussed.

The front-end of the DApp helps users generate transactions and send them to the user's blockchain wallet. After the user signs and confirms the transaction using the blockchain wallet, the transaction will invoke the smart contract of the DApp. However, users bear the following risks when using DApps because of the potential inconsistent behaviors in DApps. First, the DApp front-end may generate incorrect transactions inconsistent with users' intentions. Second, the smart contract may have misbehaviors when executing the transactions. Inconsistent behaviors of DApps not only lead to user confusion but also cause significant financial losses. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to identify inconsistent behaviors of DApps on EVM-compatible blockchains by contrasting the behaviors of DApps that derived from the front-end, blockchain wallet, and smart contracts, respectively. We implemented our approach into a prototype named DAppHunter. We have applied DAppHunter on 92 real-world DApps of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and successfully identified 37 DApps with inconsistent behaviors.
